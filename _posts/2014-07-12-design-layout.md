## Visual Hierarchy
Arrange elements to engage and direct the users eye.

* English is read from left to right, so start from the upper-left corner especially with logo/brand.
* Next is navigation.
  * Few items -- Horizontal (top bar) or Vertical (side bar) works well.
  * Many items -- Vertical excels.  Horizontal works if it's a tiered system.
  * Dropdowns/Flyouts -- works well in both systems.
  * Vertical navigation is not used that much
* Main Content -- content should reinforce the hierarchy
  * Make sure all directional cues are pointing to the content.
      * e.g., Use images of people that look towards the content (see image below).
* Secondary Content -- should be smaller and relegated to the side or underneath the main content.
* Footer -- bottom of the page and provides quick hint information for users. 
  * It should always span the width of the page.

## The Grid System
* It is made up of vertical lines that create columns with gutters in-between them.
* It also has horizontal lines that create a baseline for text that is equal to the line-height.
* Always respect the gutters

### Fixed vs Fluid
Fixed grid has constant width.  A fluid grid grows and shrinks with the browser window.

## Incorporate Whitespace

Ample empty space around elements can increase readability and create a mood of elegance.

* Even in images, there's white space that's surrounding the subject.
* Density is lack of whitespace.


## Balance all the things
A good design is a balanced design.  It can be symmetrical or asymmetrical.

* Symmetry -- portrays a sense of stabilty and trust.
* Asymmetry -- effective in drawing attention and breaking monotony.  It is inherently balanced, and creates intrigue and demands attention.

### All of the principles together Contribute to Balance.
Size, Color, Contribute, Alignment (grid), Whitespace (or lack thereof–density) and Symmetry create balance.

## Final Notes:

* If you can't defend it, Change It
  * Design with intentionality, the ability to defend your design decisions in a conversational manner. If you can’t defend it, its probably not the right choice.
* Experiment Often
  * The first solution is rarely the best one, don’t rush the process.
