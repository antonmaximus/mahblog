September 2019 sent me into deep saddening thoughts. This was mainly due to my medical school application. After finishing a slew of about 30 secondary applications from September, the application process finally took its toll on me since I was no longer busy and I had enough time to look at the body of work I put in for the past 2.5 years. I finally started wondering what I did wrong throughout my application: MCAT tests that could have been better, GPA that could have been better, being pressured by online gunners to retake a decent MCAT test, secondary essays that could have been better (Carle Illinois especially), getting sucked in by my scribing job that caused me to forget my path for a moment. Nonetheless, I also saw things that I did well: my commitment to my community service and my love to find a meaningful career.

I also had a few moments of revelation while doing my secondary: how I've been pushing my comfort zone, my love for lifelong learning, and finally being at peace with HKN and admitting how emotionally immature I was at that time (and not the greatest leader—definitely a lot of learning opportunities from here!). I've also become more appreciative of my community service as a suicide prevention phone counselor because it has helped me  emotionally grow and develop emotional skills. 

One thing that has kept my vitality for productive living is consistently going to the gym. Once I'm in the gym, I'm able to feel great for 1.5 hours through intense physically activity. I'm sure the hormones and endorphins are all helping me, but in a way it's given me enlightenment, and daily consistent moments to emotionally, mentally, and spiritually heal. 

On another note, I also picked up chess at home to keep my mind pre-occupied. The only downside is that I've gotten  addicted to playing chess that it has hampered my daily productivity! Took me 2 days to finish laundry that I've been putting off for months!

With that said, I finally had a moment of vindication with my medical school application! I got an interview with TCU and will be flying to Texas! Oh, and I also had my first random Daniel dream since his passing. Miss you bud! I wish I was more appreciative and spent more time when you were here! I'll remain connected with the rest of our friends!
