<h2 id="inquiry-4-lifeline">Inquiry 4: Lifeline:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>9: Won 2nd Place in declamation contest.</li>
  <li>16 – The 4F Class President year.  This was an awesome experience. It was a leadership experience that I did not expect, but I definitely took the responsibility and embraced the challenge.</li>
  <li>18-19 – PUP Chapter. I lost my two front teeth.  It was a good introduction to Engineering courses.  Life was slow because I remember I was merely waiting to be taken to the U.S.</li>
  <li>20 – New American Years. Collin County Years. I was a sponge. I was absorbing everything: the culture, the language, the class lessons.  I was fighting for grades and boy was I winning.  I then started dreaming of graduating and getting that diploma that would make me happy.</li>
  <li>22-25 – The UT Chapter. This was my destination. I was very stoked and I loved being part of it. Then I lost sight of myself when I became the HKN president. I put HKN before me – lesson learned.  Then, I got my diploma. I thought life would be easier for me.  It was the American Dream, right?  Sadly, there was nothing waiting for me after I received my piece of paper.</li>
  <li>26 – The Quorum Chapter, which was my first real job out of college.  It took me several months before I got my job.  My role was very technical and I was pigeon-holed to be a programmer – I did not like it. I remember waking up and dreading going to work.  Suffice it to say, I quit.  I then set my eyes to a nuclear escape by pursuing grad school in CG – after all, I love films right?</li>
  <li>28 – The Grad School Chapter.  It started out strong, but did not end like an accomplishment because I bailed before I finished.  I had a chip on my shoulder all through out.  I was not the friendliest and if anything, I was a stubborn Mr. Know It All.  The journey was horrible for I did not make great relationships with a lot of people.</li>
  <li>30-32 – The Lucasfilm Chapter.  This was my destination. When I got here, I thought life would be like heaven. If I weren’t laid off, I probably would have quit or would have been fired after another year. I did not enjoy what I did.  I remember confiding to Vivek that I wanted to do something else. I was not happy coding I guess or making beautiful images?  I definitely developed an eye for design and understood art details really deeply.</li>
  <li>34 – The Front-end Developer Chapter.  I did it. I was finally a developer and was making really good money. After a year, I remember not being happy about it and started wondering what life would have been had I pursued medicine.  I’m starting to realize that maybe the destination (the company, the title, the salary) is not what ultimately will make me happy.  I don’t even know what happiness is.  But I do enjoy the challenge of learning and improving.</li>
  <li>
    <p>35 – Major Existential Crisis</p>
  </li>
  <li>What would I most like to accomplish between the years of X and Y?</li>
  <li>What would I want to have done?</li>
  <li>Who would I like to be by then?</li>
  <li>
    <p>What would I like to have by then?</p>
  </li>
  <li>I would like to be a father by 45.  I would like to have done being in a leadership position – whether as a product manager or technology advocate.</li>
  <li>I would like to have continued my learning on the body more.</li>
  <li>I would like to have gotten more confidence in talking to romantic interests.</li>
  <li>I would like to learn Spanish too.</li>
  <li>I would like to be able to talk through my chest more consistently before I reach 36.</li>
  <li>I would like to have a meaning romantic relationship by 40.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeahbuts are a problem only when you seek to add new dimensions to your life; to take a giant step.  Whenever you are considering taking a giant step, it is useful to assume that every thought that opposes taking this step is a Yeahbut thrown at you by your internal survival mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="inquiry-5-yeahbuts">Inquiry 5: Yeahbuts</h2>

<p>Make a list of Yeahbuts that have power over you, and arrange them in order</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t know if it’s the right job for me.</li>
  <li>What if I end up disliking what I choose?</li>
  <li>I’m still deciding on what to do next.</li>
  <li>I need to develop confidence first.</li>
  <li>I need to finish this self-help book.</li>
  <li>I’m old.</li>
  <li>I’m not charming enough.</li>
  <li>I’ll just reddit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inquiry-6-dealing-with-yeahbuts">Inquiry 6: Dealing with Yeahbuts</h2>

<p>Two main techniques for dealing with Yeahbuts: creating commitments and developing a network of people who support you to follow through.</p>

<p>Other techniques are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a list of them and concentrate on the big guns. Give them a name to identify them better. “Here comes old number 9.”</li>
  <li>Learn mindfulness meditation – feel every finger typing in or swipe</li>
  <li>Allow them to come into your mind unopposed. Do not fight or resist, but just acknowledge.</li>
  <li>Study them from a distance. Be a scholar.</li>
  <li>Make displays that keep you present.</li>
  <li>Pretend they are a voice coming over the radio rather than from inside your head.</li>
  <li>Convert them to allies. Turn them into a to-do list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most common decision-making methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Logic, analysis, common sense.  They list the pros and cons of the careers they are considering, assign numerical values to them, add up the scores, and – presto! – the career with best pro/con ratio wins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feelings, inclinations, passions. People who use feelings to decide say they rely on intuition or “go with the gut.” Nothing wrong with that, but, again, we aren’t deciding; out feelings are. Feelings are like weather; they come and go. Feelings themselves have lives of their own. We don’t control them any more than we control the rain. Let them be the spice, not the recipe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Romantic yearnings. People imagine themselves in careers (or people) and then fall in love with the image they created. We float on a cloud of sweet dreams, envisioning ourselves in the midst of a glorious future. One of the reasons the divorce rate is so high is that people marry a fantasy rather than a real person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resonance. Instinct, intuition, or “going with your gut feeling.” Sometimes a feeling like a soft wind blowing through their head; sometimes a voice that says, “This is right.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External source. The media, experts, parents, spouses, friends, magazines, career counselors, common sense, and horoscopes. It’s amazing how many people follow the recommendations of others to make the most important decisions of their lives. Whatever you do, don’t become a doctor because it would your mom happy. She will not have the get up every morning and go to work with you. No one can possibly know you as well as you can. No one will ever care as much as you do how well your life works. External sources are fabulous research tools, but please don’t abandon the helm of your ship to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reaction, rebellion, compliance. Doing the opposite of what you don’t like about what you are doing now, doing the opposite of what you are told or expected to do, or going along with what “they” want you to do all turn you into a puppet. Rebellion and compliance are two sides of the same coin. These are all reactions to the external. You as the decision maker are nowhere in sight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Random. Just let it unfold, go with the flow, take the promotion you are offered, roll the dice, choose the major with the shortest registration line, look in the want ads, and select a career because you think they might offer you the job. If this method had a sound, it would be “Oh, well.” This method implies that it doesn’t matter, and maybe you don’t matter either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shoulds and Yeahbuts. People are often propelled into doing all sorts of things they don’t really want to do because of the little voice in their head that tells them what they should do and shouldn’t do. One of the noisiest voice is the one that constantly compares you (and everyone else) to a fixed set of standards and ideals. This voice rates the people we meet (and ourselves) by attractiveness, intelligence, class, erotic potential, ability, degree of fit into our social order, and a long list of other criteria. When you are thinking about possible careers, it babbles and gabbles away, letting you know, in no uncertain terms, exactly what’s wrong with you or whatever you are considering. Since it is mechanistic (you know that because you can’t stop it), it has no creative imagination or enthusiasm for possibilities outside the data it has gleaned from your past. The Shoulds operate very much like Yeahbuts, and they both cloud the decision-making process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="inquiry-7-practicing-free-choice">Inquiry 7: Practicing Free Choice</h2>

<h4 id="1-pay-attention-to-how-you-make-decisions-now">1. Pay attention to how you make decisions now.</h4>

<p>Write down three important decisions you have made over the last few years.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving to Los Angeles – I started with logic because anything significantly south of the Bay Area was sure to be warmer. Then I did research by casually interviewing people that have lived in LA. Finally, I did an analysis via graph by comparing annual temperature average between cities I have lived in.</li>
  <li>Choosing to camp in my car until I find a great match of people to live with. – I started with Resonance. I wanted only to move in with people if I feel we’re on the same wavelength. Then, it became “Random” and I just things unfold to the point that I was living in a car because I have yet to find anyone to live with. The Random part was something I weathered because I knew deep inside I would only want to live if I found a good match. And when I found a good match that “resonated” with me, I made the plunge.</li>
  <li>Choosing Lucasfilm vs EA vs back to College Station – I started out with a romantic yearning that grad school should be done in 2 years. When the time came to choose between Lucasfilm and College Station, I doubled down on the romantic yearning by envisioning myself to be on my way to becoming a Technical Director and eventually a Director just through sheer hard work. The Lucasfilm vs EA was an easier decision because EA offered a 3 month gig.</li>
</ul>

<p>Write down three less important decisions you have made in the last few months:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting on PrEP – I used logic. If I want to decrease my chances of contracting HIV, which is prevalent in the my target population, I should protect myself.</li>
  <li>Spending $100 on lunch – Going with the flow. Random. I wanted to enjoy time with Syed, so joining him in something he enjoys was worth the price.</li>
  <li>Staying at Tonchi’s – It was Random (going with the flow and gut feeling) at first because it less of a hassle to not to book and commute to an airbnb. This was furthermore validated with logic because I saved money, gas, and commute time, and had a better quality time with Tonchi.</li>
</ul>

<p>How well does this method or methods work for you? How well do the decision hold up over time?</p>

<h4 id="2-learn-all-you-can-about-the-matter-in-question">2. Learn all you can about the matter in question.</h4>
<p>The secret of free choice is revealed in the second definition: “to select freely, after thoughtful deliberation.” Use the conventional decision-making tools we discussed earlier as telescopes and microscopes.  As research tools they provide you with everything you need to know: access to all the diverse aspects of your personality as well as practical information about the external world. You don’t need to be told to use your habitual methods and techniques. That will happen all by itself. You need to use the other ones you don’t typically use: If you normally lay out reasons on a spreadsheet, delve into your feelings. If you usually look to the outside world for answers, make sure to listen for the soft internal voices that say “What if…?” and “I wonder…” Explore all of it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Metagoals. The first step in goal setting is to get clear about these metagoals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product Manager – to do something technical that involves more face-time with people.</li>
  <li>UX/UI Designer – a marketable skill that can help my front-end dev and product management skills. A safe tangent away from programming.</li>
  <li>Doctor – Becoming a wizard. Fame/Social Status? Really good money?</li>
  <li>Physical Therapist – Because I enjoy working out, and it’s a step above being a Personal Trainer.</li>
  <li>Personal Trainer – Because I enjoy working out.</li>
  <li>Front-end developer – my escape from the entertainment industry.</li>
  <li>1,000 Club – I want to set a milestone on my strength. Helps to gauge where I’m at when I tell people.</li>
  <li>Gym Owner – Because I enjoy working out and I want to be a business owner. More face-time with people.</li>
  <li>Business Owner – that’s where good passive income is.</li>
  <li>A relationship with someone – I want to feel loved romantically. I’m thankful for having friends and family.

<p>Rewards</p>

<p>To some degree, your identity consists of  your relationship with yourself and your relationship with the world around you. Any quality you include as an important part of your identity ca be fortified or undercut by the realities of your career. People who think of themselves as caring may not thrive in a job where they constantly have to get tough with others. A job that allows them to manage in their naturally supportive style offers more rewards, primary among them that they can be themselves on the job.</p>
