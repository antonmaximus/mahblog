## Section 3: Design Your Career

# Design Your Career

> "I'm making a commitment to design my Future Work." 
> 
> ~Anton AJ Jett Jose JA Agana. 16 Oct 2016


    I promise to decide on what I will do with myself in regard to my work 
    throughout my life.  
    I promise to figure it out and do my best -- everyday. 
    I will train myself not to make the mistakes in evaluating potential 
    jobs that I have made in the past.

    I'm also finding out that each person is different and have learned to 
    respect individuals on that. 
    I promise myself to understand this uniqueness that I am and find 
    that suitable career work. And at the same time, 
    I promise myself to not give myself excuses because of this difference.


> There is no such thing as feeling "courageous." It is an imaginary emotion. Courage consists of doing what you said you would do even when you don't want to. In the face of danger, you have a choice to be the delegate of either your commitments or your feelings. It's as simple and as difficult as that.

# Part 1: Who Am I? -- Personality, Talents, Roles, Functions

#### Chapter 15: Temperament & Personality

#### Inquiry 13: Temperament

* E:17 vs. I:13
* N:18 vs. S:14
* T:16 vs. F:10
* J:16 vs. P:14

According to numbers, it's ENTJ. ENTP is the next closest supposedly. Though, I see myself having qualities from almost all of them. I could easily fluctuate between E and I. I'm more leaning on N, but can be S sometimes. I'm stronger in T than F. And J and P fluctuate.

ENTJ: Born to lead, outgoing, involved, fully engaged, ambitious, take-charge, impersonal, hearty, robust, type A+, impatient, bossy, controlling, confrontational, argumentative, critical, sharp-tongued, intimidating, arrogant, direct, demanding, strategic, tough-minded, organized, orderly, efficient, long-range planners, objective problem solvers. Self-determined and independent. Skilled verbal communicators. Firmly believe that their way is best. Hold on o their point of view without compromise until some brave soul is able to convince them, through extensive argument and definitive proof, that another way is better. They consider all aspects of life to be the playing field for their favorite game: monkey on the mountain (king of the hill). Their energy is focused on winning, getting to the top, beating the competition, reaching the goal. See life and evaluate other people as part of this game. Assess others hierarchically, above them or below them on the mountain. Tend to look down on people who will not engage them in competition. Often generate hostility and rebellion from their employees and children. Show affection for others by helping them improve. Seek power. Learn by fully engaged discussion (also known as arguing). At their best planning and organizing challenging projects, providing the leadership, straight-ahead energy, and rive to keep up the momentum, and efficiently managing people and forces to reach the objective.

administrator, athlete, computer systems analyst, consultant: management, corporate executive, credit investigator, economic analyst, engineer: project manager, entrepreneur, financial planner, lawyer, manager: senior level, military officer, mortgage banker, office manager, president/CEO, program designer, sales, marketing manager, stockbroker, supervisor, team leader.


On 16 Oct 2016, I'm an ESFJ with flexibility. If Myer-Briggs has taught me anything, it's that I'm in the middle of almost everything with slight leaning on Extroversion.




#### Chapter 16: Your Core Personality

#### Inquiry 14: Tribal/Maestro Orientation

I'm between a Maestro & Tribal according to the test. Though, I personally would say I have slight preference towards Maestro. Then, I'm an Extroverted Maestro to distinguish it further.

Extroverted Maestros are performers. They are experts or masters in a particular area, at their best performing their mastery in front of others. Not only do they see the world in a highly personal way, but they are compelled to use their talent, knowledge, and wisdom in an extroverted manner. When geared to take a lead role as an expert, they direct, advise, and guide others in special technical competence who develop a loyal following. Examples: college professor who love the classroom, seminar leaders, spokespersons for technical subjects, politicians, actors, comedian, performance artists, physicians in high-contact specialties, charismatic leaders, consultants, trainers, orchestral conductors.

#### Chapter 19: The Games of Life
#### Inquiry 18: What Am I Playing For?

My main games are personal growth and knowledge (30 Oct 2016). A more detailed worksheet is located in the Purpose Folder. 

#### Inquiry 19: What Games will I Play?

*Ask yourself these questions:*
- Are my main games worth playing?
- How well is it working for me to play the games I do?
- Do I want to keep playing them?
- Do I want to promote or demote any of them?
- Will I take on any new games that are more worthy of playing?


My main games are worth playing. I want to keep playing them. They are worth it. It's when I don't play them  
(eg., lose focus/sight) that when I become miserable. I would also like to take on the game of awakening.
I've caught myself on autopilot especially when dealing with unusual situations where I left without an 
equal footing (eg., that time someone told me to unrack weights without asking why, that time failing to understand 
that Kyle was showing interest)

Awakening -- Players discover that they are rarey present, mainly functioning on autopilot, and take on the game of waking up.


*What games would you like to wake up to in the morning and play wholeheartedly, every day?*

I'd like to play the games of personal growth, knowledge, and awakening every day.

*What sort of work would best serve to help you to win the main games you intend to play?*

Doctor? Leader? 

*What are some of the qualities, functions, activities, and rewards that a job might offer that would help you win the games you 
intend to play?*

*What might interfere with winning the games you most want to play?*

One major interference I could see is me focusing on the aesthetics. Failing to look beyond the superficial.
