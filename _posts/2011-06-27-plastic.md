Rule of thumb when it comes to plastic: avoid them altogether.  If you really have to use plastic to store food or beverages, check the bottom and see if it's labeled #2, #4, or #5.  These are categories of plastics that have low risk of leaching chemicals.  The keyword here is "[low risk](http://www.kabntr.org/plasticsucks/the-7-types-of-plastic-what-they-mean-to-your-health/)" because they still do leach chemicals.

At the time this article was written, [BPA (Bisphenol A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A)) seems to be the current concern.  However, a plastic container that is BPA-free may still contain other chemicals that have yet to be tested to humans.  After all, plastic is made from chemicals.


Here's some recommendation:

* Avoid using them (duh).  Use glass instead.
* If you have to use them, minimize the use -- like during special occasions when you'll need a bunch of storage.
* As of this writing, limit your use only #2, #4, & #5 plastics.  
* Do not expose them to extreme heat as their chemical composition may react.  In other words:
  * Do not pour hot liquid in them
  * Do not use for microwaving (yeah, including TV dinner)
  * Do not leave them in a car that's exposed to the sun where you can bake cookies (literally)

 Also, on a side note... Some manufactured tin can drinking bottles contain small amount of BPA.  This includes soda cans, beer cans, and canned food (another reason to avoid canned foods/drinks).  So before switching to tin cans, do your research.
