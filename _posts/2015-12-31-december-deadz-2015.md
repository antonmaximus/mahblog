It's that time of the year again!  

Last December 2014, I had a goal of pulling close to 4 plates.  Looking back now, that goal was wayyy too ambitious.  Furthermore, after being plagued with illness every couple of months, my deadlifts has now gone down.  The graph best display how my deadlifts have gone the past year (note that there were a couple of months with missing info as I went through some dark times).

The good news is that in the past year, I've discovered that my deadlifts need to have a more vertical back.  I learned via lifting forum that my lower body is shorter than my torso similar (just like most Asians). Hence, a more vertical back at the start position is expected.


As for my deadlifting goal for next December, I'm looking to pull 3 plates (315 lbs).  I'm currently pulling 275 lbs for 5 reps.
