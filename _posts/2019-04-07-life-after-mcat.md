On 5th April 2019, I took my MCAT. MCAT is a ridiculously long standardized exam that is taken in one-sitting for 7.5 hours (which includes a total break of 50 minutes). "Horrible " is an understatement to describe what I've gone through preparing for months for this exam. I've never experienced such high chornic stress in my life that lasted for months which peaked in January and February -- the most horrible time to be stressed because the winter cold weather compounded the stress; I felt I had bouts of depression in between. 

Also during these months, I could only muster 4-6 hours of sleep every night, which I attribute to high stress. No matter what I did to better my sleep (like getting in bed at 10PM, exercising in the gym during the day, etc.), I could not sleep beyond 4-6 hours. I also ended up injuring my lower back at the gym, which I attribute to poor sleep and not doing a self-check that I wouldn't be able to lift 100%. Lifting was my main source of de-stressing.

I was also too stupid to experiment on a new diet. For about 3 weeks, I consumed all of my day's calories in one-sitting in order to save more time  for studying and perhaps be able to take the 7.5 exam without breaks. Big mistake. My lifts further went down and I loss muscle mass. I should have known that the body doesn't store proteins or amino acids; hence, consuming all of them in one-sitting wouldn't allow them to be in my system to last 24 hours. Kinda disappointed in myself.

I was able to get my mojo back when I started doing cardio outdoors. Being in SoCal, I was able to play pick-up beach volleyball games. Am not sure if it was being out in the sun for hours or getting my heart rate ridiculously high due to constant running to chase balls that got me to get back my sleep to 7-9 hours again, but I was so glad to have found a much needed outlet. It also helped my studying because I noticed I found a groove studying for days.

Anyways, though that my MCAT is done, I feel that I'm not out of the woods yet. If I get a score of less than 125 in any section, I'll probably have to re-take it. The long wait for the score release in a month begins. 



Next Goal: Learn how to articulate and speak with distinction. Learn to ride a motorcycle. Learn olympic weightlifting properly.
