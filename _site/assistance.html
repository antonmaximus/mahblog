<h3 id="romanian-deadlift">Romanian Deadlift</h3>
<ul>
  <li>RDL is perhaps the best assistance exercise for deadlifts and cleans because it works the very things that cause heavy deadlifts to be missed</li>
  <li>The best cues for good form on the RDL are “chest up,” “arch the back,” and “knees back,” with an occasional reminder to keep the weight off the toes. The chest cue will remind you to keep the thoracic spine in extension, while arching the back usually gets interpreted by most people as a low-back cue.</li>
  <li>The weights that will be used forheavy RDLs are not really heavy relative to the deadlift, with most people being able to use between 65% and 75% of their 1RM deadlift for the exercise, so using a plain old double-overhand grip will not usually be a problem.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stiff-legged-deadlift">Stiff-legged Deadlift</h3>

<p>The SLDL is essentially a deadlift done according to the five steps outline previously, but without Step 3, the dropping-the-shins-forward-to-the-bar part.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This means that the bar leaves the floor from over the mid-foot but is still in the air while in front of the shins.</li>
  <li>When the bar is just above your knees, it comes onto your legs, and the pull is then locked out like a regular deadlift at the top.</li>
  <li>Again, each rep is replaced on the floor, reset, and pulled from a stop; it is a deadlift, not an RDL, and each rep starts from a dead stop.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="good-mornings">Good Mornings</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Choose rounded-back over straight-back</li>
  <li>The round-backed goodmorning deliberately employs less-than-optimum spinal mechanics in order to strengthen the back against the inevitable occurrence of bad mechanics during a fatigued deadlift attempt or a normal day at work.
    <ul>
      <li>It is a relatively safe way to introduce this position in the context of a controllable, increasable barbell exercise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There will never be a reason to use more than 35% of your squat for sets of 8-10, and there is no reason to do them at all until 35% of your squat is 95 pounds.</li>
</ul>
