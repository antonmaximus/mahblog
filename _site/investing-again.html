<p>I’ve looked into investing pretty heavily about 5 years ago.  I wish I made notes of the terms that ought to be remembered and the approach I followed.  Oh well, it’s not too late to refresh my memory and make notes.  So here goes…</p>

<p>It’s 2014.  The approach I’ll be using is making my portfolio.</p>

<h2 id="november-note">November Note…</h2>
<p>Since I’ve been procrastinating  reading those fun reads mentioned above, I just went straight to the meat and bones.
The first resource I went to was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics">reddit’s /r/personalfinance sub</a>.
Here’s the plan of action:</p>

<h3 id="1a-emergency-fund">1a. Emergency Fund</h3>
<p>This is typically the basic Savings Account.  It’s a fund where you can easily take money from
 for the unexpecteds: job loss, appliance replacement,
medical procedures, unexpected travel, and more.  Since it’s easy to have access to
the money, its downside is that the interest you earn won’t be high.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the ideal size for an emergency fund?</strong> If you’re already an expert in your career (i.e., you’re
sought-after), a fund for 6-months of expenses will work.  However, if you feel you’re
in the early stages of your career (i.e., a lot of uncertainties), a fund for 12 months of expenses
is a good bet.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of accounts should an emergency fund in be?</strong>  Emergency funds should be held in safe investments
that can be liquidated in a hurry – Savings &amp; Checking account, CDs (Certificate of Deposits), and I-bonds.</p>

<p>Another good way letting your money work for you is to have the E-Fund in tiers as seen below, 
so you can take advantage of the higher interest rates that some accounts offer.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tier 1: Checking account – holds 2 month worth of expenses.</li>
  <li>Tier 2: Savings account – holds 4 month worth of expenses.</li>
  <li>Tier 3: CDs and I-bonds – holds 6-12 month worth of expenses.
    <ul>
      <li>The drawback of these accounts require a relatively longer investment time (e.g., 6 months)
for it to yield interest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1b-higher-education-expenses">1b. Higher Education Expenses</h3>

<h3 id="2-employer-sponsored-matching-funds">2. Employer-sponsored matching funds</h3>
<p>You want to ensure you get the guaranteed free money to its full-extent.  That’s all there is to it.</p>

<h3 id="3-pay-down-high-interest-debts">3. Pay down high interest debts</h3>
<p>I’ve heard the rule of thumb that over 6% is <strong>high</strong>, under 4% is low, and between that you trust your gut.
In context, the average inflation rate is 3%  and the average stock market return is 7%. Hence,
by paying those high interest rates, you’re ensuring yourself to not lose money by that much.</p>

<h3 id="4-additional-savings-for-retirement-in-an-ira">4. Additional savings for retirement in an IRA</h3>
<p><strong>Why contribute to an IRA? Shouldn’t I go back to my 401k?</strong> Choose IRAs, since they are opened by individuals with a provider of your choice, are generally better than 401k plans because you have more fund choices. Low cost providers like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer low expense ratio index funds to invest in. However, if you have an excellent 401k plan such as the U.S. Federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan or work for a large company that has negotiated institutional rates for the mutual funds in their 401k plan, you may want to “Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plan” (i.e., 401k) first and return to your IRA contribution afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="5a-maximize-contributions-to-employer-sponsored-plan">5a. Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plan</h3>
<p>After covering all bases, now is a good time to maximize the contributions to 401k.<br />
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k">Here’s a link to tips on how-to</a></p>

<h3 id="5b-save-for-non-retirement-goals">5b. Save for non-retirement goals</h3>
<p>Well, this is a toss-up compared to 6, since both deals with paying yourself either way.
Non-retirement goals include paying down a house sooner, vacations, vehicles, babies, 
and the like.  Just keep in mind that (especially for a young person) the more time your money has to grow, the more powerful the effects of compounding will be on your retirement savings.</p>

<h3 id="6-save-for-retirement-in-a-taxable-account">6. Save for retirement in a taxable account</h3>
<p>If there’s still lump sump after covering all the bases, open a taxable brokerage account and invest according to your retirement asset allocation. You’ll want to have a decent grasp on <a href="http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation_in_multiple_accounts">asset allocation in multiple accounts</a> and <a href="http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement">tax-efficient fund placement.</a></p>

<h2 id="december-note">December Note…</h2>
<p><em>“Not All Income are Taxed the same.”</em>  This is what I learned after watching <a href="http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy">Boglehead’s Investment Philosophy</a> where the basic building blocks of investing is discussed.</p>
