    <p>I was back to the grind in the past few weeks and found myself doing quite a few interviews.<br />
I’m a mid-level programmer and by no means the perfect interviewee, but <br />
with enough practice/repetition I became <br />
a better interviewee overtime and became more aware of the dynamics that take place which <br />
I haven’t seen in a long time being away from interviews.</p>

<p>Throughout the slew of final interviews I went through at various companies, there were <br />
a few things that stood out when I could tell the interviewers were unprepared.</p>

<p><strong>1. They asked for a copy of my resume.</strong>  No they weren’t testing me if I was prepared<br />
and brought copies to the interview.  When I handed my resume to them, they had this <br />
hurried look on their face that said, <em>“Let’s see what’s interesting here,”</em> or <em>”<br />
What’s a good question to ask about from this resume?”</em>  You could literally tell that<br />
it was their first time seeing the resume.</p>

<p>I noticed this more from C-level officers at startups.  They’re startups, so I’m <br />
sure they didn’t have much time or manpower to devote – but still, it was a flag for me.</p>

<p><strong>2. They would ask outright BS questions.</strong> I noticed this from the same interviewers who<br />
gave me the impression that they’ve never seen my resume.  Since <br />
they already lack information about what’s on my resume, they naturally gravitated to <br />
asking questions that wouldn’t expose their ill-preparedness.</p>

<p>These questions are the ones that would make your mind react with <em>“What the hell? <br />
Are you really asking that? You can do better than that”.</em>  And my mind did react like that.<br />
 Nonetheless, I still gave my answers to them.<br />
However, my only <strong>regret is that I didn’t ask the questions back as a courtesy</strong> – <br />
and this is how you determine if a question is fair or if it’s silly and embellished in corporate jargon. For example…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>What did you dislike about your previous job?</em></strong> This question has “It’s a trap!” written <br />
all over it since it already assumes that there were things you disliked about your ex-employer<br />
and that you’re supposed to unleash the dirty dishes.  If one were to ask back the question, this would be <br />
<em>“What did you dislike about your ex-employees?”</em>  – Is it obvious now how ridiculous it sounds?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>What are your 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses?</em></strong> Now imagine you ask back, <em>“What is your<br />
company’s (or the interviewer’s) 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses?</em>” Sounds silly to me.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, it’s always a courtesy to ask the same questions back in a healthy business <br />
relationship. They could have gotten much better mileage from simpler questions, <em>“How was working for X?”</em>, <em>“What was your last project like?”</em>, or <em>“How was your day?”</em>. It could just be me, but BS questions being asked for a<br />
mid-level position just grinds my gears.</p>

<p><strong>On the contrary,</strong> there were a couple of hiring managers that impressed me with their preparation. One<br />
hiring manager mentioned a cheesey line from my spiel written on my website; suffice it to say hearing it made me laugh<br />
because I was caught off-guard… and that it was really cheesey.</p>

<p>What impressed me most was that she inquired further on a project displayed on my site.  This proved<br />
that in addition to reading up on my resume, she also looked at my site – a process that would have taken no more than<br />
10 minutes for any hiring manager.</p>
