There comes a time when a guy has to graduate from sneakers. After doing research on what shoes I'd like to partake in for the next years of my life, I felt to seek bucks, bluchers, and loafers. 


## My Style

I'm a shorts man. It's the most comfortable attire for me because of my thick athletic legs. For this reason, I've decided to incorporate shoes that can work with shorts. I've discovered bucks, bluchers, and loafers through research and am now embarking to get into them.
