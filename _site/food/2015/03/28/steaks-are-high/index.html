    <h1>The steaks are high</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Since I&#39;ve started living the &quot;simple life&quot; back in 2013, the majority of my diet consists of eggs, steamed fish, steamed chicken, and steamed vegetables.  As anyone could imagine, steamed anything doesn&#39;t really taste too well because you lose all of the flavors -- which I was fine with because the food is clean, food cooks fast, and cleaning is a breeze.</p>

<p>However, recently I started to feel that I need to add diversity into my diet while still keeping it clean (i.e., no processed foods).  So occasionally, I&#39;d go and order some piece of steak at a restaurant.  However, this left me unsatisfied for the following reasons: 1.) The portions are too small and overpriced for their size, and 2.) I would need to spend time to drive out, order, and wait for it to be ready.   Needless to say, the ROI is not worth it. </p>

<p>So I thought, why not learn how to cook steaks properly.  After searching through some reddit posts on how to cook steaks, I was brought to <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html">this site</a>.  What I like about it that it&#39;s simple: pan-seared steak. No oven necessary. And below is my take away...</p>

<p><strong>1. The tools.</strong>  I plan to learn the ways of the cast-iron skillet (I got it from Amazon).  Also, I&#39;ll be using a thermometer.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Cut.</strong> Ribeye, New York Strip, Tenderloin, and T-bone.  In that order.  T-bone is ought to be avoided (if possible) because it requires a more advanced technique of cooking due to the bone.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Grade.</strong> All beef that&#39;s sold in the U.S. is graded by the United States Department of Agriculture on a scale according to its tenderness and degree of marbling. The grades are: Prime, Choice, Select, and Canner.  Only about 2% of the beef sold in the US is Prime.  Choice and Select are what you find supermarkets. Canner is at school lunches and dog food.</p>

<p><strong>3. The Thickness.</strong> Try to go for at least 1.5 inch in thickness.  <em>&quot;Without an adequately thick steak, it&#39;s very difficult to get that contrast between exterior and interior that is so desirable. Thin, thin steaks will tend to overcook before they can finish developing a nice crust.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>4. Aging.</strong> This is more advanced for the basic cook (so I&#39;ll leave this out for now). In fact, it is pretty much impossible to dry age properly at home.</p>

<p><strong>5. Bone-in, Bone-out.</strong>  This is pretty minor.   A bone accomplishes two things: It prevent some moisture loss by reducing the surface area of a steak, and it keeps that section of the steak from overcooking by acting as an insulator.  Sure there&#39;s that extra moist, but you&#39;ll have to learn the ways of basting to ensure the meat in the bone area gets cooked properly.</p>

<p><strong>6. The Salt.</strong> USE KOSHER SALT, not regular table salt.  Season it at least overnight.  A couple of days or more if possible.</p>

<p><strong>7. Cook with Oil. Add butter later.</strong>  Milk proteins in butter get burn when too hot.  Butter is best added to the pan a few minutes before it&#39;s done cooking.</p>

<p><strong>8. The Flipping.</strong> It&#39;s actually slightly better to flip often.  Nonetheless, this is minutiae.</p>

<p><strong>9. The Baste.</strong> This is basically spooning hot fat over your meat.  </p>

<p><strong>10. Add Aromatics.</strong> After the butter is melted, add a handful of herbs such as thyme or rosemary, along with some sweet alliums like shallots or garlic. They pop and sputter, releasing their aromas and rapidly infusing the fat with their flavor. When you baste, you&#39;re adding that aroma with each spoonful.</p>

<p><strong>11. Let it Rest.</strong> <em>&quot;If you cut the steak open as soon as it comes off the grill, the juice has only one place to go â€” onto your plate. On the other hand, allow the steak to rest until its temperature has normalized, and the juices will distribute themselves more evenly throughout its interior.&quot;</em></p>
