  <p>“I’m making a commitment to design my Future Work.”</p>

  <p>~Anton AJ Jett Jose JA Agana. 16 Oct 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>I promise to decide on what I will do with myself in regard to my work 
throughout my life.  
I promise to figure it out and do my best -- everyday. 
I will train myself not to make the mistakes in evaluating potential 
jobs that I have made in the past.

I'm also finding out that each person is different and have learned to 
respect individuals on that. 
I promise myself to understand this uniqueness that I am and find 
that suitable career work. And at the same time, 
I promise myself to not give myself excuses because of this difference.
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no such thing as feeling “courageous.” It is an imaginary emotion. Courage consists of doing what you said you would do even when you don’t want to. In the face of danger, you have a choice to be the delegate of either your commitments or your feelings. It’s as simple and as difficult as that.</p>

  <p>~Pathfinder</p>

<ul>
  <li>E:17 vs. I:13</li>
  <li>N:18 vs. S:14</li>
  <li>T:16 vs. F:10</li>
  <li>J:16 vs. P:14</li>
</ul>

<p>According to numbers, it’s ENTJ. ENTP is the next closest supposedly. Though, I see myself having qualities from almost all of them. I could easily fluctuate between E and I. I’m more leaning on N, but can be S sometimes. I’m stronger in T than F. And J and P fluctuate.</p>

<p>ENTJ: Born to lead, outgoing, involved, fully engaged, ambitious, take-charge, impersonal, hearty, robust, type A+, impatient, bossy, controlling, confrontational, argumentative, critical, sharp-tongued, intimidating, arrogant, direct, demanding, strategic, tough-minded, organized, orderly, efficient, long-range planners, objective problem solvers. Self-determined and independent. Skilled verbal communicators. Firmly believe that their way is best. Hold on o their point of view without compromise until some brave soul is able to convince them, through extensive argument and definitive proof, that another way is better. They consider all aspects of life to be the playing field for their favorite game: monkey on the mountain (king of the hill). Their energy is focused on winning, getting to the top, beating the competition, reaching the goal. See life and evaluate other people as part of this game. Assess others hierarchically, above them or below them on the mountain. Tend to look down on people who will not engage them in competition. Often generate hostility and rebellion from their employees and children. Show affection for others by helping them improve. Seek power. Learn by fully engaged discussion (also known as arguing). At their best planning and organizing challenging projects, providing the leadership, straight-ahead energy, and rive to keep up the momentum, and efficiently managing people and forces to reach the objective.</p>

<p>administrator, athlete, computer systems analyst, consultant: management, corporate executive, credit investigator, economic analyst, engineer: project manager, entrepreneur, financial planner, lawyer, manager: senior level, military officer, mortgage banker, office manager, president/CEO, program designer, sales, marketing manager, stockbroker, supervisor, team leader.</p>

<p>On 16 Oct 2016, I’m an ESFJ with flexibility. If Myer-Briggs has taught me anything, it’s that I’m in the middle of almost everything with slight leaning on Extroversion.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-16-your-core-personality">Chapter 16: Your Core Personality</h4>

<h4 id="inquiry-14-tribalmaestro-orientation">Inquiry 14: Tribal/Maestro Orientation</h4>

<p>I’m between a Maestro &amp; Tribal according to the test. Though, I personally would say I have slight preference towards Maestro. Then, I’m an Extroverted Maestro to distinguish it further.</p>

<p>Extroverted Maestros are performers. They are experts or masters in a particular area, at their best performing their mastery in front of others. Not only do they see the world in a highly personal way, but they are compelled to use their talent, knowledge, and wisdom in an extroverted manner. When geared to take a lead role as an expert, they direct, advise, and guide others in special technical competence who develop a loyal following. Examples: college professor who love the classroom, seminar leaders, spokespersons for technical subjects, politicians, actors, comedian, performance artists, physicians in high-contact specialties, charismatic leaders, consultants, trainers, orchestral conductors.</p>

<p>Career fields that use spatial orientation: some medical specialties, forensic science, physical therapy, chiropractic, dentistry, speech pathology, architecture, most engineering disciplines, physics, microbiology, organic chemistry, robotics, computer architecture, computer game design, microelectronics, most design fields, hair styling, farming, culinary arts, sports, construction, kitchen and bath design, auto mechanics, carpentry, navigating, battlefield command, manufacturing, dance and choreography, special effect in film, sculpture, and other fields that require ad ability to mentally visualize in 3D. Careers that fit people with a tangible orientation are sometimes appropriate for spatial people as well.</p>

<p>Career fields that use concrete results: Dentist, surgeon, mechanical engineer.</p>
