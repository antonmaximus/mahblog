        "I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again." 

*"We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem?"* Dale Carnegie's second principle in Handling People validates the power of positive reinforcement versus the power of fear, shaming, and humiliation.  You can have others do things for you through fear, threat, and shaming, but all of these are not as powerful as positive reinforcement.  Charles Schwab once said:


*"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people. the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.  There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault."*
    
This got me thinking... in the past week, how many times have I told anyone how much I appreciate them or have simply acknowledged their presence/existence?  The first thing I did before finishing this chapter was sending a 'thank you' text message to a friend.  It felt good.


As an experiment to myself, I'm keeping a conscious effort to give at least two sincere appreciation/compliments each day. My theory is that this will help me find the good things in people.
