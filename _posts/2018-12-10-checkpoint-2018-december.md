Failed again. It  seems I always zone out from Spring through Summer and then at the end of year, I start to track my lifts again. Next Goal: Track myself in February. Am not sure how many times I'd be tracking myself next year, but my goal is to stay close to what I feel matters to me: lifting. 

Nonetheless, it has been a very interesting year: I got a major left wrist injury while doing Cleans in early March and that extended through August, I studied for MCAT (which I eventuall postponed for 2019), and quit my stressful hospital job. Of course, this affected all of my lifts especially Deadlifts, but I should have been **aware** on what matters all throughout and not get pulled in. 

There were also some of the positive things that happened this year: figuring out a new meal schedule that can help me prepare for MCAT and improve my daily routine (hint: first meal starts at 3PM or so), discovering remineralization of teeth via coconut oil, understanding how cavity works, and discovering the use of toner thanks to my little sister.

As an attempt to K.I.S.S., I've  now decided to streamline on how I track my lifts: I will only be doing 1 rep maxes for the squats and deadlifts. I've also noticed that I've been tracking my Squats and Deadlifts separately, so I will now combine them. 

Furthermore, after looking at my spreadsheet data for my lifts, I have some past data on my 1 rep maxes that I kept track randomly. The good news: I can use them as my starting information for all of my 1 rep maxes. The bad news: the lifts suggest my strength have gone down over the span of 2 years. It sucks to know, but now I am **aware**.

Next Goal: Checkpoint in February 2019.
