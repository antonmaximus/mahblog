Truths:

* You're more likely to eat healthy if you only purchase healthy items at grocery stores.

* You're more likely to see results from your workout if you focus on the major lifts. 

* You're more likely to do productive work when the phone is off.



The Pareto Rule: roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Figure out the 20% causes
that matters to you because they will effect 80% of your life. 




Time is the most important asset. Amplifying the 20% that matters (and muting the rest)
will effect the 80% for a wholesome life.


There's too many junk food at the grocery store. There's too many junk apps at the app store. 
Focus on the 20%.

Keep. It. ~~Simple~~ Lean. Stupid.
