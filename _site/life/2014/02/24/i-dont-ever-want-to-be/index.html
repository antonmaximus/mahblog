    <p>I ran into <a href="http://themanlyrules.com/2014/02/02/30-things-i-dont-ever-want-to-be/">a blog article about being your own man</a>.  I thought the content was pretty hilarious and that they rang true, so  I thought maybe I should start crossing ones out as if it were my list…</p>

<ol>
  <li><del>A gross fat sweaty mess that sucks the public coffers dry by placing demands on the state because I’m too lazy to manage my own lifestyle.</del></li>
  <li>An apologist for all that passes as acceptable in a society content to celebrate mediocrity.</li>
  <li>45 years old, struggling to get and maintain an erection when looking at my pig wife with the consolation of watching some sports team every weekend in a public house full of other losers drinking overpriced poison (with ice) contemplating where it all went wrong whilst deriving a miniscule amount of pleasure/displeasure from said sportsmen who couldn’t give a flying fuck about me. Interspersed by standing outside in the pouring rain and wind chugging on a cancer stick bringing my sad existence ever closer to a painful finale.</li>
  <li>A whiney bitch who fails to take action whilst complaining about his lot in life.</li>
  <li><del>Someone who would rather watch mind-numbing television instead of picking up a book.</del></li>
  <li>Living a lifestyle dominated by a woman that I’m too scared to stand up to.  (Unless I succomb to ‘fear’ #3 above and I’m paying for it.)</li>
  <li>Someone who can’t relax and is unable to take life on the chin a little and laugh at what the universe throws up every now and again.</li>
  <li>Someone who is malnourished and feeds a corrupt ‘health care’ system that is purely run, not to prevent disease, but rather treat symptoms and further the greedy needs of a pharmaceutical industry from top to bottom and pops a multitude of pills just to get through each day.</li>
  <li><del>Someone who ashamed to look at himself in the mirror.</del></li>
  <li>Constantly worried about money and never experiencing financial freedom.</li>
  <li><del>Someone bitterly consumed by politics who shouts political rants at a TV screen as he feels his needs aren’t being met.</del></li>
  <li>Scared to face reality and accept life for what it is.</li>
  <li>Someone who needs to attack others for personal gain or a twisted sense of validation.</li>
  <li>Someone who seeks validation at all.</li>
  <li>In a place whereby I feel I need to rely on ‘things’ to impress people.</li>
  <li><del>An habitual user of pornography because I lack human interaction.</del></li>
  <li>A ‘white knight’ who attempts to impress women by sacrificing my masculinity in their honour.</li>
  <li>Lacking in quality friendships and connections.</li>
  <li>Someone who is blind to other people’s standpoints before analysis of them (whether they are ultimately wrong or otherwise).</li>
  <li>Unable to explain to others why I hold certain viewpoints.</li>
  <li>Too weak to challenge viewpoints I consider wrong after analysis (see #19).</li>
  <li>Working a job I hate.</li>
  <li><del>Living in a place I hate.</del></li>
  <li>Someone who has ceased to experience new things and lives a mundane life of repetition.</li>
  <li><del>Unable to enjoy physical exercise befitting of my age.</del></li>
  <li>Angry and full of regret.</li>
  <li>Lacking in depth and being one-dimensional.</li>
  <li>Addicted to anything other than the simple joy of living.</li>
  <li>Suffering.</li>
  <li><del>Unable to think of a 30th point for a blog post entitled ’30 Things I Don’t Ever Want To Be…’</del></li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve crossed out a few items that stood out to me as something I’ve successfully trumped at this point. I’ll visit this again in a year’s time and see what other items I feel I’ve conquered.</p>
