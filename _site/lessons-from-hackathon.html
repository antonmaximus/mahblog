    <p>I attended a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/redesign-a-ux-design-hackathon-tickets-10500873395">UX Design Hackathon</a> this past Sunday in Santa Monica.  A few takeaways from my observation…</p>

<p><strong>The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less.</strong>  This paradox applies to design, but it’s funnier when one realizes it applies to forming a team.  The hackathon event started with an hour long breakfast, where participants mingled to form teams.  The good news was that there were more than a hundred participants.  The bad news was that one could be tempted to reach out to all of them – which I did (maybe because it was my default setting).  If I were to talk to each one for one minute, the most I could talk to would be 60 people in one hour.  Hence, I’m sure I wasn’t able to talk to half of them.</p>

<p><strong>A five-hour UX design Hackathon is not enough time.</strong>  It seemed that everyone was gung-ho about delivering a product.  Each group picked a team meber from each background (e.g., programming, design, UX/UI, etc.) to ensure that all kinds of tasks would get covered – not a bad idea if you ask me.  However, at the end of the day, no one was able to deliver a finished product and all final presentations were PowerPoint slides of theoretical solutions.  It seemed that picking a team member based on skillset wasn’t useful for that five-hour task.  I wonder how the experienced would have been if teams picked their members based on some other criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Make it more personal.</strong>  According to the science of persuasion (video below), exchanging personal information and identifying similarities before tackling business leads to 90% more agreeable outcomes. My next goal is to make a conscious decision to start  group work like this.</p>

<p>The hackathon was definitely a good way to spend the day.  It made me think about the Psychology of team dynamics and product delivery.  I’ll definitely tweak a few things on my approach the next time I do it.</p>
