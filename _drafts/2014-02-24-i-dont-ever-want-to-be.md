I ran into [a blog article about being your own man](http://themanlyrules.com/2014/02/02/30-things-i-dont-ever-want-to-be/).  I thought the content was pretty hilarious and that they rang true, so  I thought maybe I should start crossing ones out as if it were my list...


1. <del>A gross fat sweaty mess that sucks the public coffers dry by placing demands on the state because I’m too lazy to manage my own lifestyle.</del>
2. An apologist for all that passes as acceptable in a society content to celebrate mediocrity.
3. 45 years old, struggling to get and maintain an erection when looking at my pig wife with the consolation of watching some sports team every weekend in a public house full of other losers drinking overpriced poison (with ice) contemplating where it all went wrong whilst deriving a miniscule amount of pleasure/displeasure from said sportsmen who couldn’t give a flying fuck about me. Interspersed by standing outside in the pouring rain and wind chugging on a cancer stick bringing my sad existence ever closer to a painful finale.
4. A whiney bitch who fails to take action whilst complaining about his lot in life.
5. <del>Someone who would rather watch mind-numbing television instead of picking up a book.</del>
6. Living a lifestyle dominated by a woman that I’m too scared to stand up to.  (Unless I succomb to ‘fear’ #3 above and I’m paying for it.)    
7. Someone who can’t relax and is unable to take life on the chin a little and laugh at what the universe throws up every now and again.
8. Someone who is malnourished and feeds a corrupt ‘health care’ system that is purely run, not to prevent disease, but rather treat symptoms and further the greedy needs of a pharmaceutical industry from top to bottom and pops a multitude of pills just to get through each day.
9. <del>Someone who ashamed to look at himself in the mirror.</del>
10. Constantly worried about money and never experiencing financial freedom.
11. <del>Someone bitterly consumed by politics who shouts political rants at a TV screen as he feels his needs aren’t being met.</del>
12. Scared to face reality and accept life for what it is.
13. Someone who needs to attack others for personal gain or a twisted sense of validation.
14. Someone who seeks validation at all.
15. In a place whereby I feel I need to rely on ‘things’ to impress people.
16. <del>An habitual user of pornography because I lack human interaction.</del>
17. A ‘white knight’ who attempts to impress women by sacrificing my masculinity in their honour.
18. Lacking in quality friendships and connections.
19. Someone who is blind to other people’s standpoints before analysis of them (whether they are ultimately wrong or otherwise).
20. Unable to explain to others why I hold certain viewpoints.
21. Too weak to challenge viewpoints I consider wrong after analysis (see #19).
22. Working a job I hate.
23. <del>Living in a place I hate.</del>
24. Someone who has ceased to experience new things and lives a mundane life of repetition.
25. <del>Unable to enjoy physical exercise befitting of my age.</del>
26. Angry and full of regret.
27. Lacking in depth and being one-dimensional.
28. Addicted to anything other than the simple joy of living.
29. Suffering.
30. <del>Unable to think of a 30th point for a blog post entitled ’30 Things I Don’t Ever Want To Be…’</del>


I've crossed out a few items that stood out to me as something I've successfully trumped at this point. I'll visit this again in a year's time and see what other items I feel I've conquered.
