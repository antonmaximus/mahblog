<p>…or as Dale Carnegie calls it, <em>“If you want to gather honey, don’t kick over the beehive.”</em>  I thought that I put a positive spin to it by removing the negation (i.e., do not kick) since positivity sticks better. Nonethless, this follows Carnegie’s first principle (I call it <strong>Technique</strong>) in Handling People in his book <em>How To Win Friends and Influence People.</em> <strong>PRINCIPLE 1:  Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.</strong></p>

<p>Point in short, if you’re about to say anything (or write or text), do not condemn or criticize.  <em>“Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.”</em> If you want to put the other person on the defensive, by all means, criticize.  Otherwise, just stay mum.  :/</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>YOUR BIG BROTHER FORGETS

Listen, li'l brother: I am saying this as you lie asleep, 
one little paw crumpled under your cheek
and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. 
I have stolen into your room alone. 
Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the living room, 
a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. 
Guiltily I came to your bedside.

These are the things I was thinking, li'l bro: 
I had been a cross to you. 
I scolded you as you were getting ready for school b
ecause you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. 
I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. 
I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor.

At breakfast I found fault, too. 
You spilled things. You gulped down your food. 
You put your elbows on the table. 
You spread butter too thick on your bread. 
And as you started off to play and I made for my bus, 
you turned and waved a hand and called, “Goodbye, Big Brother!” 
and I frowned, and said in reply, “Hold your shoulders back!”

Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. 
As I came up the road I saw you, down on your knees, laying marbles. 
There were holes in your stockings. 
I humiliated you before your friends by marching you ahead of me to the house. 
Stockings were expensive - and if you had to buy them yourself 
you would be more careful! Imagine that,li'l brother!

Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the living room, 
how you came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? 
When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, 
you hesitated at the door. “What is it you want?” I snapped.
You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, 
and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, 
and your small arms tightened with an affection 
that the gods had set blooming in your heart 
and which even neglect could not wither. 
And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs.

Well, li'l bro, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands 
and a terrible sickening fear came over me. 
What has habit been doing to me? 
The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding - 
this was my reward to you for being a boy. 

It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of you. 
I was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years.
And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. 

The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. 
This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me good night. 
Nothing else matters tonight, li'l brother. 
I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt here, ashamed!
It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things 
if I told them to you during your waking hours. 

But tomorrow I will be a real brother! 
I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. 
I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. 
I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: 
“He is nothing but a boy – a little boy!”

I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. 
Yet as I see you now, li'l bro, crumpled and weary in your cot, 
I see that you are still a baby. 
Our parents abandoned us early in life, 
and I had wanted you to be a grown man too soon, 
but now I understand you can only grow in your own time. 
I have asked too much, too much.
