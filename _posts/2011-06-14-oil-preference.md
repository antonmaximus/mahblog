There was a time when frying was my main form of making meals in addition to sandwiches. During that time, there was a stigma about saturated fats (albeit, that stigma is still perpetuated today).  I ended up researching all about saturated fats and concluded [that it is healthy](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/fats/) and should be a staple in one's diet.  

When choosing oil for consumption, I go for oil that do not go rancid when heated, and this is where saturated fats come in. Polyunsaturated fats become oxidized when heated -- and we open ourselves up to [free radicals that affect cell membrane damage, wrinkles, arterial plaque build up](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/fats/), and many more.  I'm gonna save the discussion about fats for some other day since this post is all about my oil preference.  The criteria I based my oil on are: heat stability and availability.  Without further ado, here's my preference of oil..

1. **Coconut Oil.** Very high in saturated fats. Always choose **unrefined**. Unrefined coconut oil starts with fresh coconut meat ensuring the extracted oil is sanitary. Refined coconut oil goes through some [unsanitary process](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/coconut-oil-health-benefits/#refined).  Labels will also indicate either "cold-pressed" or "expeller pressed."  The former means that the oil was processed in temperature less than 120F, while [the latter is less than 210F]((http://www.coconutoilfacts.org/cold-pressed-coconut-oil.php). Coconut oil can stand very high heat so, the nutritional difference between the two is minimal.  In short, cold-pressed has a tad more nutritional value, but expeller pressed is not too far off.


2. **Butter/Lard.** It's best for cooking in high heat. Bonus points if you can have your waiter cook your meat in butter at restaurants since butter is readily available at restaurants compared to coconut oil.

3. **Olive Oil.**  Really good for salads, sauces, and dips -- anything that doesn't expose the oil to heat.  Choose [Extra Virgin Olive Oil](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-all-olive-oil-created-equal/) (local brand is just as fine as the italian ones and is cheaper).  If the labels allow, choose olive oil that is unrefined and cold-pressed. Use the oil [within a year's time](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/olive-oil/).



Another oil that deserves special mention is palm oil.  It is high in saturated fats and is heat stable.  The only issue with palm oil is availability.  In fact, [palm  oil plantations enroach](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/healthy-oils/) the habitat of dwindling orangutan populations which makes its production more controversial and painful.


As for the ones to avoid, pretty much everything else: corn oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, grape seed oil, sunflower seed oil, safflower oil, and peanut oil. These are to be avoided because they've gone through some [major modifications](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/healthy-oils/) -- after all, no matter how much you squeeze corn or vegetable, it's quite impossible to extract oil from them naturally.
