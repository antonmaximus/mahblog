This week is my former boss's last week at Lucasfilm, and those of use who were close 
to him were asked to create a going away note which will be presented to him on his final day.
I ended up being more creative than I thought.  I originally intended to just create a poem.  After
everything's been done, an awesome backdrop has been made along with the poem using GIMP.

Farewell, Rob!  T'was a ride.


## O Captain! My Captain!

*O Captain! My Captain! Our fearful trip is done;  
The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;  
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,  
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring.*

*O Captain! My Captain! You sailed the ship to the beat of its drum;  
One by one your men has gone, and now your time has come.  
Through triumphs, through turmoil, and all else in between, 
All we can say is “Thank You.” What a journey it has been!*

*O Captain! My Captain! Farewell to thee…  
In your new voyage I know you’ll be set free.  
‘Tis time for a new adventure, a new ship, and a new crew.  
Make us proud, make it true, may your focus be you.*
