## Pick the Color Scheme...

Orange is the color of Energy, Happiness, and Vitality.  These qualities embody 
improv, so this will be the main color of the Improv Masters site. And what goes well with
orange? It's complementary blue, of course.  Hence, here's the scheme:

## Typography

Since improv is within arts and culture, the type will be in Modern Serif Fonts.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/improvMasters_typography.jpg"  width=""/>


{% highlight ruby %}
font-family: Didot, “Didot LT STD”, “Hoefler Text”, Garamond, “Times New Roman”, serif;
{% endhighlight %}
