Today I received my blog's web hosting bill from Amazon Web Services. What
used to be 52 cents have been multiplied 5,300 folds.  I'm guessing a few 
people got hold of my blog and the link was passed around. Hence, now 
I'm switching to [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Github Pages][github-pages] for support!

The transition was pretty simple and everything has been pretty straightforward.
I guess it also helped that I've used Github in the past and have tinkered with
[The Middleman][middleman] in my previous web projects.

The transition is not complete yet, but I have a good 85% of it set.
