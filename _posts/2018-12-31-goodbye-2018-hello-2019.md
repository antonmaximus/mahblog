Those that prefer to spend NYE partying out would probably frown on how I'm spending tonight: Spending NYE by myself, and I am happy and content. It's quiet, calm, and peaceful. Earlier in the night, I already sent my wishes to my loved ones and friends, so the rest of the night is all for me. 

It wasn't until a few nights ago that I finally was able to get my sleeping pattern consistent and have been able to put in at least 7 hours of sleep each night. A few weeks ago, I would churn in anywhere from 4-6 hours. I ended up being always restless and weak. 

What am I thankful for? 

* Knowing myself more. Got to know how I act under pressure when spending someone who I have romantic interest with. 
* Got to know more on what matters to me more. 
*  Being able to put in at least 7 hours of sleep.
