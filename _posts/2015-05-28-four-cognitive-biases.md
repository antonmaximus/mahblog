Study shows that there are many biases in our decision-making process. Below are the top four biases that cloud judgment.


## 1. Self-serving bias.

People attribute sucesses to moslty themselves and that all failures are due to others' shortcomings. 

* Pros: Protects self-esteem (and lessens depression)
* Cons: Can't learn from mistakes and improve (because one doesn't take responsibility for failures)
* How to Overcome: Be with close friends who can call you out and keep you grounded. 



## 2. Cognitive Fluency.

It's how easy an idea is to process and understand; the more fluent the idea, the more we unconsciously trust it.   

* Pros: Can be used to influence other people.
* Cons: Whether something is easy has nothing to do with truth -- which lead to an **illusion of truth**.
* How to Overcome: If something sounds too good, question it.


## 3. Sunk-cost Fallacy.

 The idea that people are more likely to endure something that already sucks if they've already invested so much into it. As opposed to cutting loses and moving on.  

 This fallacy stems from our intense aversion to loss.  The thought that we wasted resources motivates us to carry on, even if it's clearly a loss cause.

* How to Overcome: Focus on future cost and benefits **not** past losses. 


## 4. Confirmation Bias.

You only search for evidence that confirms your beliefs.  This explains why so many people stick to many unscientific beliefs.

Another consequence is that the framing of question is vital.  *Are you happy with your life?* vs. *Are you unhappy with your life?*

* How to Overcome: Search for **contradictory** evidence.
