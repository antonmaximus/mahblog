TCU Interview was 10/21/2019, Monday.

The TCU interview went awesome! Okay, it was not that awesome "awesome," in fact I worke up 4-5 times the night prior and was not able to get enough sleep. Nonetheless,  I am very thankful for being invited to be interviewed. It made me feel that my qualifications were good and I felt validated, especially being part of the first set of interviewees (there were 11 interview days, and I had the option of signing for the 2nd or 3rd week, where I chose the latter).

What went right: 

* I was able to connect all of my answers to my experiences. 
* Had plenty of practice leading to the interview!
* Dressed right. 
* Consistent with my meal pattern night prior and during (eg., kinds of food and timing)



What could have been better: 

* The way I spoke could have used more paralanguage and gestures.
* "mistake" == "learning opportunity" (Oprah: there are no mistakes, there are only learning opportunities.)
* Role-play on how you would say your "approach" in front of interviewer. In short, act some of the dialogue out instead of telling.
* Take more time to give context. For example, your "entire tech career" gave you the understanding and not just Lucasfilm.
* My necktie. I need to learn how to properly tie a tie. 
* Full-on Role-play:  
  - Thank them for sharing (highlight bravery!) 
  - Check safety (breathing exercises too!) 
  - Ask "Emotions Experienced" (Validate!) 
  - Whole message: (My Observation on what I objectively see about them in their actions. My thinking that the problem won't be solved overnight and can recur again. My feeling that we need to be strong through this moment and recurring times. My need for them to continue to be brave and reach out to me and more or safety plan!). 


Practice Interview:

1. Tell me about yourself. 
  - Importance of family, hobbies, career, what you're looking for. 
  - What you've gone through: assimilating as an immigrant and the emotions experienced (e.g., isolation), mistakes and learning opportunities in life, various experiences (career, volunteer roles, etc.)
2. Minimize Ummms.  Have command of your paralanguage. (Vocalics is study of paralanguage, which includes the vocal qualities that go along with verbal messages, such as pitch, volume, rate, vocal quality, and verbal fillers.)
3. Why do you want to become a doctor?
  - Being involved with the medical decision making process.
  - Enjoyment in problem solving, especially coming from an engineering background.
  - Involving the humanistic side (eg., compassion, empathy, etc.) in work.
4. What are your strenghts?
  - Culturally competent: experienced as an immigrant, living in red and blue states, assimilating, working with diverse group of people  when volunteering for the disadvantaged.
  - Experience: Work experience, immigrant experience, culture shock, assimilation, suicide/crisis prevention counselor experience.
5. Weakness and how do you overcome them?
  - Putting myself out there, no matter how uncomfortable it is. It always gradually gets you there.
6. Why should we accept you?
  - Share how you fit at the school.
  - That's a questions reserved to those who has seen all the applicants, and I'm not one of them. I cannot assume that I am better or worse than they are. If there's anything important in medicine, it's to never assume. Nonetheless, I do know this: I've gained various experiences that is valuable to share: experience immigrating and assimilating, experience of having a career in the tech industry (and even working for George Lucas), experience saving a life as a suicide/crisis prevention phone counselor, and experience tutoring homeless youth in an urban city like LA.
7. Where are you 10 years from now? 
  - Be more definitive. Know yourself. Pinpoint the definitilve answer.
8. Do you have any questions for me?
  - What advise would you have if your younger sibling or family member is choosing between 2 or more medical schools?
