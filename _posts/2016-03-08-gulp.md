Installing Gulp is as eas as 1, 2, 3...



###1. Install Gulp Globally

`sudo npm install gulp -g`


###2. Install Gulp to the local project

a. Have a `package.json`   by typing `npm init` or creating it manually.

b.  `npm install --save-dev gulp`  -- to install Gulp into the project locally.  The `--save-dev` keyword tells the computer to add `gulp` as a dev dependency in `package.json`.  


###3. Create a `gulpfile.js` file and write your Gulp Tasks!


The first step to using Gulp is to `require` it in the gulpfile.

    var gulp = require('gulp'); 


The require statement tells Node to look into the `node_modules` folder for a package named `gulp`. Once the package is found, we assign its contents to the variable `gulp`.

We can now begin to write a gulp task with this `gulp` variable. The basic syntax of a gulp task is:

    gulp.task('hello', function() {
      console.log('Hello Zell');
    });

We can run this task with `gulp hello` in the command line.

    $ gulp hello



####Installing other plug-ins to your project...

We can compile Sass to CSS in Gulp with the help of a plugin called `gulp-sass`.  We install it by using `npm install`.  We'd also want to use the `--save-dev` flag to ensure that gulp-sass gets added to `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
    
    $ npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
