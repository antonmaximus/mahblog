The best way to make a person do something for you is by arousing in them the desire/fire to accomplish it for themselves.  Sure, placing fire under one's ass would get the other person moving too, but that person would only work until his skin is at a good distance from the flame. 

We always think about ourselves.  When we look at a a group photo, the first face we look at is ourselves [p62].  When we talk in a conversation, the part we enjoy the most is when we talk about ourselves.  So when influencing the other person, Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.
So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.


The most effective way to deal with people is – an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle. Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.



  "First, arouse in the other person an eager want He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way."
