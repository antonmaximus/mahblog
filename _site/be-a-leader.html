<p>In Dale Carnegie’s <em>“How to Win Friends and Influence People,”</em> he noted ways on influencing people. To me these points can be summarized into: creating a friendly atmosphere, nourishing the other person’s self-esteem, and instilling fire.</p>

<p><strong>1. If you must find fault, begin with Praise and Honest Appreciation.</strong>  “It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.”</p>

<p><strong>2. Call attention to people’s mistake indirectly.</strong> Never use “but…” when addressing a mistake.</p>

<p><strong>3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.</strong> <em>“I concluded that Josephine’s batting average at nineteen was better than mine had been – and that, I’m sorry to confess, isn’t paying Josephine much of a compliment.”</em></p>

<p><strong>4. Ask questions instead of giving orders.</strong>  This is principle is best described making the other person be actively involved in creating the solution the situation.  Asking someone, “Are you wrong?” won’t fix the issue, but asking, “What do you think is the best solution” proabably would.  Besides, no one likes to take orders.</p>

<p><strong>5. Let the other person save face.</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. To Spur People into Success: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.</strong>  Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.’  Animal trainers have been using this technique for ages.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  "Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of 
  B.F. Skinner’s teachings. 
  This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals 
  and with humans that when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, 
  the good things people do will be reinforced 
  and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention."
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.</strong>  This becomes an exciting challenge to live up to for anyone.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make the Fault seem Easy to Correct.</strong>  Use encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>9.  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.</strong>  The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attitudes or behaviour:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</li>
  <li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</li>
  <li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</li>
  <li>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</li>
  <li>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</li>
  <li>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could give a curt order like this: “ John, we have customers coming in tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter.” Or we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will get from doing the task: “John, we have a job that should be completed right away. If it is done now, we won’t be faced with it later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our facilities. I would like to show them the stockroom, but it is in poor shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the shelves, and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and you will have done your part to provide a good company image.”</li>
</ol>
