On 20th July 2019, I took my MCAT and got my score of 500. I went down from the previous 506 last April. It was a big disappointment. I feel like I cut my chances of getting into an MD school by half. Things that I wish I did:

* I wish I was more honest with myself. When I re-took the practice exams, I had a deal with myself that I would need to see improvement on CARS. The CARS remained the same. 
* Be thankful and see possibilities. I was quick to write off a 506. Little did I know, pleny of schools take that. 
* Reflect regularly. Be able to understand and appreciate how much work was involved. 

So what now? Well, since I already sent about 30+ applications, I will have to stay the course. Also, I made a promise to myself in 2015-2016 when I last had a moment of "visitation" (where I felt I had to do some deep "introspection" about "what was the point of life?") and that I would do my very best to find that career my life deserves. So yeah, I'm okay sitting out for another year and improving my MCAT. I hope that's the only part of my application that's holding me back.
