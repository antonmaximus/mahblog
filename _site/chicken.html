<p>With my recent use of a broiler for fish, I tried to incorporate it to chicken breasts (since the grocery store had a sale on chicken breasts recently)…</p>

<p>Cooking chicken breasts is very basic <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMaplo1J6w" target="_blank">as seen in the video</a>.  There are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never under cook chicken meat, as you can get sick.</li>
  <li>Boneless chicken breasts dry out easily, so avoid overcooking.</li>
  <li>Cook time: For boneless/skinless chicken breast, about 20 minutes. (Temperature: about 350 Fahrenheit)</li>
  <li>Drizzle with oil or melted butter especially if it becomes too dry.</li>
  <li>Vary the seasoning and experiment for your tasting pleasure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Best of all, chicken breasts have great nutritional reputation (boneless, skinless chicken breast):</p>
