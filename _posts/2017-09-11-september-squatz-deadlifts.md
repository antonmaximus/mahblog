## I've lost Track. Sadly.

Three years ago was the last time I tracked my squats and deadlifts. It's not until 
now that I've decided to keep a blog it. I failed at tracking myself. 

## A workaround: Keep it simple stupid. Keep things lean. Embrace Yourself. Own it. 

I've accepted the fact that it's a spiral path and things are not linear. I've noticed
the past 2 years that every summer, I always not want to work lift hard. I'm not sure
if it's the summer bug or just the heat, but my best lifts have always been in the 
fall. So now, I embrace myself and own this. I plan to take summers off. 


To make things simple, I've decided to do 1 rep maxes for my squats and deadlifts. 
Below are my PRs for this September 2017.
