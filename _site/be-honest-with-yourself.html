<p>The worst situations that I’ve been in were the times when I was not honest with myself.
Simply put: I betrayed myself.</p>

<p>One of the biggest betrayals I did to myself was when I hung out with a person I had 
zero romantic interest with. I was interested in their friend, which turned out to be a
fake persona. I was catfish’ed. I hung out with the person for 11 days in hopes of seeing 
the  “friend” that has suddenly become unavailable because of family issues.</p>

<p>Had I been true to myself, I would have not compromised my values. I would not hang out
with someone who had romantic interest in me that I could not return even if it means there 
was a promise of “introduction with the other person I was interested with.” If I was honest
with myself, I would 
have reached out to the person of interest myself  one-on-one, no strings attached – even
if it means getting rejected.
In the end, I paid the 
ultimate price: time, money, and heartache. I spent countless hours, days, and months chatting up 
two fake people. I spent money traveling only to find out they’re suddenly unavailable. 
And I fell in love with a non-existent person, and had to pick myself back up.</p>

<p><del>Another betrayal I did was when I forced myself to remain in the tech industry for my career. I wanted
to stay in the tech industry doing front-end web development. For starters, being a front-end
developer was already a compromise of not  wanting to be a hardcore programmer while 
benefitting from tech industry incentives. Anyway, after getting laid off, I really did not want to 
be a developer anymore. 
I felt I was killing myself inside even before I got laid off. But since it was the only thing
I knew how to do, it was the only thing I could be considered for. Hence, I sought out
front-end developer jobs. I should have looked inwards and should have been honest with myself 
on what I really wanted to do.</del> Well, this is not betrayal. This is part of the process 
of finding the right track. You try various paths and see if it feels right for you. Though,
you were not honest with yourself when you interviewed for positions you were not 
excited about.</p>

<p>I also made another compromise with myself to do product management. 
I guess I was trying to make a compromise of staying within the 
tech industry and reap its benefits while not doing programming work. Now that I think of it,
I may have not been fully honest with myself. I did like product management for its 
leadership opportunities while being technical still. Though, was it intellectually stimulating
enough for me?  I am someone that needs the intellectual challenge, physical challenge, and leadership challenge.</p>

<p>The best decisions I’ve ever made were the times I was honest with myself. After geting laid off
for the first time, I knew I wanted to leave the Bay Area. My gut feeling and my weather analysis were in unison.
I went to Los Angeles without anything lined up and it was tough moving into a new city without knowing
anyone for support. I managed to stay the course and eventually settle after a few months
because I was true to myself.</p>

<p>Applying to jobs?  Be honest with yourself and see if the company (heh) is something you’d
like to be part of.  If you don’t want their company, don’t force yourself to be part of it.
Listen to you gut.</p>

<p>Considering hanging out with someone for romance? Be honest with yourself and ensure there are no
strings attached or any sort of compromises.</p>
