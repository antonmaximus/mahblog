    <p>As with any ancillary exercise, it is much better to get good reps with a lighter weight for sets of 5, 8, or 10 and do several across than to lose the benefit of the exercise with a weight that is too heavy.</p>

<h2 id="1-chin-ups-and-pull-ups">1. Chin-ups and pull-ups</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A good rule of thumb is that when you can do 12-15 body weight reps, it is probably time to start doing some of the work weighted.
    <ul>
      <li>Possibly alternating higher-rep bodyweight workouts with lower-rep weighted workouts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The primary benefit of the exercise lies at the ends of the movement.
    <ul>
      <li>The bottom stretches out the lats, and the first shrug of the stretched-up scapulas down is all lats and upper back muscles.</li>
      <li>The finish at the top is biceps and triceps</li>
      <li>Cutting the rep short at either the top or the bottom is as bad as squatting high</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Microload the program by adding 1.5-2 pounds to three sets of five reps every workout.
    <ul>
      <li>Many people have made steady linear progress like in the bench press and press</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-dips">2. Dips</h2>

<p>The dip is a good substitute for the bench press if it cannot be done for some reason, and is far superior to the decline bench press, which there is no good reason to do. If the “lower pecs” and triceps are the object of your desire - the apple of your eye, as it were - then dips are your exercise.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The anterior aspect of the movement is provided by the slightly inclined torso position, a function of the fact that the forearms stay vertical during the whole movement.</li>
  <li>Select your grip and jump up into position on the bars, with your elbows locked and chest up.</li>
  <li>Continue down until your shoulders are below your elbows (below parallel)</li>
  <li>Lock out the elbows at the top between reps</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-barbell-rows">3. Barbell Rows</h2>

<p>Barbell rows are not a substitute for power cleans. Barbell rows start on the floor and end on the floor, each and every rep.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The most critical factor of the technique of the barbell row is the back position: the spine must be locked into extension, with the chest up and the lower back arched, the whole time the bar is moving.</li>
  <li>Take a big breath, raise the bar from the floor with straight elbows to get it moving, and continue bringing it up by bending your elbows and slamming the bar into the upper part of your belly.
    <ul>
      <li>This movement leads with the elbows, and you should think about slamming your elbows into the ceiling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Don’t attempt to hold the bar against your belly at the top or lower the bar too slowly; the barbell row is like the deadlift in that the work is intended to be mainly concentric.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-back-extensions-and-gluteham-raises">4. Back extensions and glute/ham raises</h2>

<p>A Roman Chair is needed (or a glute/ham bench).</p>

<h2 id="5-curls">5. Curls</h2>
