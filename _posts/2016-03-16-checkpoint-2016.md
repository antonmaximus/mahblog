Writing this in December 2018. Me and my 2 gym buddies -- Otto and David -- went to Barbell Brigade. All of us have never been to it and it's been popularized by several Instagram people. Since I have 3 free passes that I received from the Fitness Expo in January, so why not?  

The place had its own personality: rough and was meant for serious lifting. It looked more like a warehouse and the major machines were squat racks, deadlift platforms, and bench press stations. We felt at home. 

I ended up doing 1 rep max for my Squat and Deadlift. My personal record thus far. Could it be possible that the weights here are lighter?
