  <article class="post-content">
  <p><strong>Progression.</strong>  This is the most important concept of strength training, and unfortunately the last concept I learned. I wish I learned it before everything else.  It&#39;s been called &quot;progressive overload&quot; or &quot;linear progression&quot; in the strength-training world, but all it means is seeing a progressive pattern overtime.  I kind of stumbled upon it when I finally tuned out of the world and just went on my own.</p>

<p>A simple example of the progression concept is pull-ups.  If the maximum pull-ups I could do last week was 10 and this week&#39;s was 13, there was progression and it means I&#39;ve developed strength.  It&#39;s also safe to assume that I&#39;ve developed muscle size (albeit very small) because there&#39;s a positive correlation between increase in strength and increase in muscle size.  For this reason, it would make sense to keep track of the progression overtime (i.e. strength) because that would indicate any increase in muscle-size.</p>

<p>One of the things that amaze me about the human body is how it learns to adapt.  If I squatted 200 lbs today for 4 repetitions, in a couple of days I would be able to increase the repetitions to 6 provided I got regular sleep and nutrition.  Now imagine if I was squatting over the course of 10 months?  How much progress would that be?</p>

<h2>The Hazy Period.</h2>

<p><strong>It&#39;s like shooting darts in the dark.</strong>  When I started lifting, it was not very inspiring.  I would go to the gym and would get some good workout, but I wasn&#39;t seeing any results even after several months of working out.  The good thing that came out of it was that I learned various exercises. The bad thing was that I wasted soo much time as there was no way for me to see where I was in the grand scheme of things.  I was in this period for a long time, and since it did not occur to me to focus on my progression, there&#39;s no data to see other than some random photos taken at arbitrary times.  :/</p>

<h2>The First Wave.</h2>

<p><strong>Keeping it simple.</strong> 
When I tuned out of the world, I decided to stop following all the recommended routines I&#39;ve read online, and decided to just focus on my own.  I kept things simple by doing upper and lower body splits.  And since I do enjoy bodyweight exercises, I felt having a calisthenics day too.</p>

<p>My Routines (In this order):</p>

<p>Lower Body Day:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Squats (Low-bar).</strong> 3 sets.  Max Reps of 8.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlifts.</strong> 3 sets. Max Reps of 5.</li>
<li><em>A whatever exercise</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Upper Body Day:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Shoulder Press (Barbell, Standing).</strong>  3 sets. Max Reps of 8.</li>
<li><strong>Chest Press (Barbell, Flat Bench).</strong> 3 sets. Max Reps of 10.</li>
<li><em>A whatever exercise</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Calisthenic Day:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stretching Routine</li>
<li><strong>Pull-up/Chin-up Medley.</strong> 3 sets each.</li>
<li>Dragon Flags. 3 sets.</li>
<li><em>A whatever exercise</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Items in <strong>bold</strong> are the main exercises, and I kept track of them to see if there&#39;s progression. At first I used my cellphone&#39;s Excel sheet for logging, but I switched to  a notebook as it proved to be more convenient.  All the bolded items when combined together make a complete body workout.  If there&#39;s an exercise that&#39;s a li&#39;l redundant it&#39;s probably chest presses because the upper chest gets activated during shoulder presses already.</p>

<p>The <em>whatever exercise</em> was any exercise that I fancied doing because I was already in the gym and I haven&#39;t even spent a full hour yet, so I might as well do an extra exercise. On days I wouldn&#39;t have time or not feel well, I would skip it.  This was usually some kind of light exercise like calf raises or dumbbell curls.  I did not keep track of the <em>whatever exercise</em>, and it&#39;s the exercise I allow myself to half-ass.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m not the best logger of all time and I started creating logs in October 2013, and I&#39;m pretty sure I started doing the routine even earlier than that. I did with the routine above for a few months.  There was small progression in the lift&#39;s numbers; however, some noticeable progression on the physique could be seen. </p>

<iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="http://imgur.com/a/kV3sR/embed"></iframe>

<p><strong>Documentation.</strong> In October 2013, I decided to start a monthly check-in and keep an electronic log of my current lifts and photos. I even created my own notation for logging sets and reps with <em>Weight: Rep, Rep, Rep</em>.  Take the squats entry  in the first photo for example. Before that photo was taken, I squatted 190 lbs with 6 reps for the 1st set, 6 reps for the 2nd set, and 8 reps for the 3rd; hence, 190: 6, 6, 8. </p>

<p>If the first set (i.e., 190 lbs at 6 reps) was converted to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">1 rep max</a>, it would be &quot;235 1RM&quot;, which I could use to compare with next month&#39;s lift. Think of 1RM as a conversion unit to compare 2 measurements with different units because that&#39;s the only way you can compare lifting 190 lbs at 6 reps vs 185 lbs at 8 reps. The items in the brackets [] are my personal notes.  </p>

<p>The first 2  months of documenting was not really inspiring as I wasn&#39;t seeing much changes.  Once the 3rd month hit, there was some noticeable changes in the photos and lifting logs.  Since then, documenting the monthly progression started to become something I look forward to every month. </p>

<p><strong>Rule on Progression.</strong> For any of the main exercises, I would do three sets (aka working sets), and in each set  I would shoot for the max reps.  Let&#39;s take squats for example.  If today I lifted 190 lbs for 3 sets with 6, 6, and 8 reps respectively.  This means that when I do squats next time, I would still use the same weight of 190 lbs for 3 sets.  The only time I would increase the weight to 200 lbs is once I hit the max reps of 8 for each set (which might take  a few weeks if I&#39;m consistent enough).  For the lower body, I would increase the weight by 10 lbs; upper body would get 5 lbs.</p>

<p><strong>Diet.</strong> During this period, I was in a very low carb diet, which was almost keto on certain days. Since I was a vagabond (a story for another blog), I would only buy food  to be finished that day.  I would eat about 1.25 lbs of cooked meat from Albertson&#39;s, a bag of vegetables, and 12 hard-boiled eggs.  There would be certain days when I would buy a couple of bananas and yogurt because I felt I needed more calories and they&#39;re cheap.  I would throw in protein powder at times.  With the exception of protein powder and yogurt, all of my caloric intake was paleo.  The chart below shows what typical food items I would eat, and the total calories would average between 2200 - 2600. In addition to all of these, I followed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting">intermittent fasting</a> way of eating where I typically would eat within an 8 hour window and fast for the other 16 hours of the day.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HodJd64.jpg" width="500px" align="center" alt="Food Log" title="Food Log"/></p>

<p><strong>Order of Exercises.</strong>  The only rule I followed was to always Squat before Deadlift.  All other main exercises could be shuffled.  Also, <em>whatever exercises</em> must be done after main exercises.</p>

<p><strong>Warm-up.</strong>  The entire point of warm-up is to get use to the motion before doing heavier weight.  I would usually do 1-3 sets of warm-up before a main exercise. The more taxing an exercise (i.e., squats) is, the more sets it would get.  The <em>whatever exercises</em> and calisthenics did not get warm-up sets.</p>

<p><strong>Resting.</strong> Rule of thumb was to be aware of my body (queue in meditation here), check if my breathing/heart rate is back to normal, and ensure that my body isn&#39;t about to go cold.  Squats and Deadlifts are the most taxing exercises, and I would find myself resting about 4 minutes between sets.  Shoulder Press and Chest Press took less time, usually about 2 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency.</strong> Witht the exceptionof being sick, My rule of thumb was that if I had ample sleep and a couple of square meals, I owe it to my body to do major physical movements.  There were days when I wasn&#39;t able to lift, so I just did calisthenics at home or a nearby playground.  Also, since I do it almosty daily, working out just became part of my normal routine, similar to eating lunch is. My internal discussions if I should workout today, for example, have stopped altogether because my mind knows working out is part of my daily cycle.</p>

<h2>The Change Up.</h2>

<p><strong>Changing the exercise because of injury.</strong>  Condensing the exercises into two days was not really necessary, and the three-day split I had was fine as it was.  The main change-up was in my style of Squats and Chest Presses because of injury. (The <em>whatever exercise</em> is now called <em>accessory exercise</em>.)</p>

<p>Lower-body Day:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Squat (Highbar).</strong> 3 sets. Max reps of 8.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlifts.</strong> 3 sets. Max reps of 5.</li>
<li><em>One Accessory Exercise.</em> 2 sets. Max reps of 13.</li>
<li><em>One Ab Exercise (Dragon Flags).</em> 2 sets. Max reps of 13.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upper-body Day:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pull-up/Chin-up Medley</strong>. 3 sets (6 total). Max reps of 13.</li>
<li><strong>Shoulder Presses  (Barbell, Standing).</strong> 3 sets. Max reps of 8.</li>
<li><strong>Chest Presses (Single-arm Dumbbell, Flat bench).</strong> 3 sets. Maxrep 10.</li>
<li><em>One Accessory Exercise</em>. 2 sets. Max reps of 13.</li>
<li><em>One Ab Exercise (Dragon Flags).</em> 2 sets. Max reps of 13.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Form and Injury.</strong> It took me several months to figure out my form for various exercises. The more I did an exercise, the more l&#39;d notice the nuances on bodily movements and what muscle group was firing (no surprise here, Sherlock).  It also helped that I video recorded my Squats, Deadlifts, and Shoulder Presses, and then later assessed them myself or asked feedback from reputable online forums with lifting coaches.  As for other learning materials, for Deadlifts, Chest Press, and Shoulder Press, I based them on the book Starting Strength 3rd Edition.  The pull-up/chin-up, I played with it.  I noticed that my back is more activated during a wide grip pull-up and a shoulder-width grip chin-up. I also learned to never lock-out on the bottom of a pull-up/chin-up to prevent shoulder injury.</p>

<p>I based my squats (low-bar) initially from the Starting Strength book too, but a low-bar style of squats caused  some knee pain; hence, I looked into the high-bar style (aka Ass-To-Grass) squats which is the more natural way of squatting (this is the squat that a toddler naturally does if he was to squat or pick something up from the ground).  I had to start from very light weight again when I switched, so I could learn and critique my form. Once I got hold of the proper motion, I felt at home with the high-bar squat.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l4YPY8p.jpg" width="500px" align="center" alt="Natural Squat Form" title="Natural Squat Form"/></p>

<p>I also have developed some shoulder pain when doing bench press with a barbell.  I switched to dumbbells and it no longer bothers me.  My observation was that barbell puts my arm in a less-natural position (probably due to length and my anatomy, I don&#39;t know).  By switching to dumbbells, my arm has been able to position itself optimally, so I experience no pain.</p>

<p>Also, since I&#39;m now doing a different style of squat and chest press now, I had to track them separately from my previous squat and chest press logs (i.e., they&#39;re a different kind of exercises and should not be considered a continuation of the old style.)</p>

<p><strong>Safety.</strong>  Weight lifting is very safe compared to any other sports (Starting Strength has the stats).  Barbell Bench Press is the only one that has killed and injured people since most people do it with no spotter or a lousy spotter; hence, I recommend to always do it with an attentive spotter.  Squats is very safe provided you use safety pins (I use it all the time); it&#39;s even safer if you know the bail-out technique (I use this too).</p>

<p><strong>Diet.</strong> After moving to an apartment, I started preparing meals on the daily.  I incorporated more carbs into my diet because I needed to increase my caloric intake;  I was already satisfying my protein and fat intake, so carb had to increase and the cheapest way was to incorporate white rice.  White rice is not paleo, but it&#39;s gluten-free -- which is not a bad tradeoff. My main source of protein was still eggs and animal meat.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cMgPDmZ.jpg" width="500px" align="center" alt="Food" title="Food"/></p>

<p><strong>Progression.</strong> The charts below show my progression on the main exercises from my monthly check-ins.  I separated the pull-up/chin-up routine in a different graph because it doesn&#39;t involve added weights.  As I mentioned earlier, Squats and Chest Press have 2 logs each (one for each style) which doesn&#39;t really help to show the overall trend of their progression because of the shorter time period.  Nonetheless, there is a trend that ought to be noticed on the deadlifts, shoulder presses, and pull-up/chin-up -- they&#39;re progressing overtime.</p>
