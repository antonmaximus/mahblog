<p>Fats are like people in your lives. Some you need to be around with frequently, 
some not too much, and some should be avoided altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fats are compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms that exist in chains of varying lengths, shapes and orders. They’re one of the vital nutrients required by the body for both energy and the construction/maintenance of “structural” elements, such as cell membranes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-monounsaturated-fats">The Monounsaturated Fats</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/monounsaturated_fats.jpg" width="" /></p>

<p>Biochemically speaking, these fatty acids sport a single double bond in their fatty acid chain. The more double bonds a fatty acid boasts, the more “fluid” it is. They are generally liquid at room temperature.</p>

<p>Monounsaturated fats are found in numerous oils, including olive oil, flaxseed oil, sesame seed oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, corn oil and peanut oil. Notice that we use the word “found” and not comprise. The fact is, these oils contain varying levels of monounsaturated fat. The rest is a mix of polyunsaturated and saturated. Olive oil, for example, contains about 75% monounsaturated fat, and canola 60%. By the way, these fats are also found in avocados and nuts. They’re granted approval (as much as any fat is in conventional wisdom) as a “healthy fat.”</p>

<h2 id="the-polyunsaturated-fats">The Polyunsaturated Fats</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/polyunsaturated_fats.jpg" width="" /></p>

<p>Polyunsaturated fats have, yes, more than one double bond in their fatty acid chain. They tend to be liquid even when refrigerated. Their problem is they also tend to go rancid easily, particularly when heated. <strong>When we heat them</strong> (and we often do), they often become oxidized. We’ve let in the Trojan Horse at that point and opened ourselves up to all kinds of free radical pillaging – everywhere from cell membrane damage to wrinkles to arterial plaque build up.</p>

<p>Polyunsaturated fats are found in grain products, soybeans, peanuts and fish oil. Fish oil and grain products in the same category! Say it isn’t so! (Heightened whispers and shuffling.)</p>

<h3 id="essential-fatty-acids">Essential Fatty Acids</h3>

<p>We call them essential because the body can’t produce them itself and must obtain them from food. 
We’re talking about omega-3 and omega-6.</p>

<p>Omega-6. It’s important, I fully acknowledge. Omega-6 fatty acids, found in corn and other grains as well grain-fed livestock, play a crucial role in dermal integrity and renal function among other things. But if left unchecked, they run amok, and spur inflammation. Egad! Ratio matters, but we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Omega-3s are found primarily in fish, algae, flax and nuts.</strong> You also find good portions of them in eggs from chickens that are fed fish or flax meal. And you’ve heard us go on and on about the three forms: ALA (think flax) as well as EPA and DHA (think fish oil). Omega-3s aid circulation by naturally thinning the blood, fight systemic inflammation, <strong>support brain function and ease symptoms of depression, anxiety and even ADHD.</strong> (Nods of approval)</p>

<p>Now back to the ratio matter. Estimates vary, but experts generally characterize Western diets as anywhere between 10-30 parts omega-6 to 1 part omega-3 (10-30:1). What ratio should we be getting? What did our primal ancestors likely eat? Try 1:1. Although many in the establishment will try to tell you that 4:1 is good enough.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the omega ratio of “monounsaturated” soybean oil is 7:1. Corn oil is 46:1. (Audible gasps, clutching of pearls, adjustment of jackets)</p>

<p>This takes us back to the question of lean meat. If you recall, my reasoning in offering some support for lean meats (in lieu of fattier meats that our ancestors ate, as a number of you reminded me) was the fatty acid ratio of the fat in modern meat. Grain-fed meats are much higher in omega-6 fatty acids and lower in omega-3 than grass-fed meats, but not everyone has access to grass-fed meats. The best way to combat the plethora of omega-6 is to watch your ratios and to consume more omega-3s.</p>

<h2 id="the-saturated-fats">The Saturated Fats</h2>

<p>Saturated fats have all avocadosilable carbon bonds paired with hydrogen atoms. The important part here is that they’re highly stable. They don’t have the same tendency toward rancidness as polyunsaturated fats, even if heated. This is a good thing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/saturated_fats.jpg" width="" /></p>

<p>Saturated fats serve critical roles in the human body. They make up 1/2 of cell membrane structure. They enhance calcium absorption and immune function. They aid in body’s synthesis of the essential fatty acids and provide a rich source of fat soluble vitamins. Last but not least, they provide cholesterol. Yes, the human body makes its own anyway, but it all balances out.</p>

<h2 id="the-trans-fats">The Trans Fats</h2>

<p>The unnatural chemical modification process that created trans fats made products more shelf stable 
(which is appealing for businesses looking to cut corners) but has wreaked havoc in the bodies of those who ingest them.
Quick fact: the hydrogenation process changes the position of hydrogen atoms in the fatty acid chain.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/trans_fats.jpg" width="" /></p>

<p>The body doesn’t recognize the transformed fats and, innocent as it is to snack food chemists’ intent, doesn’t know to eliminate it. The trans fats are absorbed through cell membranes, where they initiate general disorder in cell metabolism.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060619133024.htm">study</a> out some months ago showed that trans fats caused a “redistribution of fat tissues into the abdomen… even when total dietary calories are controlled.” Kidding about profiles aside, abdominal fat (i.e. apple shaped body) has been associated with the build up of fat around internal organs, which has in turn been associated with a higher risk of heart disease.</p>

<h2 id="interesterified-fats">Interesterified Fats</h2>

<p>Insteresterified fats are a new breed of chemically modified fats created to avoid the trans fat label now reviled and even outlawed in some cities. Like trans fats, these fats go through <strong>a kind of hydrogenation process</strong> along with the associated rearrangement of fat molecules and an enrichment with stearic acid. The point is the same as it was with the trans fat poison, er process: it makes the product more shelf stable.</p>
