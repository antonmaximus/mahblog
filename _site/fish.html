<p>For the past decade, I’ve been avoiding fish for two reasons: mercury content and  too much cooking effort.  I’ve been a fool for believing believing all that mercury stuff without questioning.  I should’ve investigated better… and sooner.</p>

<p>I did my investigation recently and found out that I’ve been missing out on these facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selenium protects against mercury toxicity, and 16 of the 25 highest dietary sources of selenium are ocean fish</li>
  <li>If a fish contains higher levels of selenium than mercury, it is safe to eat</li>
  <li>Most species of commonly eaten fish in the U.S. have more selenium than mercury</li>
  <li>Fish are not significant sources of PCBs and dioxins when compared to meat, dairy or vegetables</li>
  <li>The benefits of eating fish regularly far outweigh the potential risks, which are neglible</li>
  <li>Pregnant mothers and young children should eat 2-3 servings of oily ocean fish each week</li>

</ul>

<p>So Fish is very safe to eat – first problem solved.  The remaining problem is cooking.  I don’t want to spend one hour in the kitchen to prepare a meal.  After doing some online research and talking to my network, I concluded that these are the 2 easiest ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Steaming.</strong>  It takes about 15 minutes to cook 4 fillets of fish.  The best part is I get to cook rice with it as well because of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aroma-Arc-743-1Ngr-Uncooked-Cooked-Steamer/dp/B0057XGM5W/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392019065&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=rice+cooker" target="_blank">wonderful device from the 90’s!</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Broiling.</strong> It takes about 15 minutes to broil fillets.  For <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0xIoM85E0" target="_blank">fish with bone</a>, it takes about 25 minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Best of all, this is the reason why I eat fish often:</p>
