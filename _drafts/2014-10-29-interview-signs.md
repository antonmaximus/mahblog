I was back to the grind in the past few weeks and found myself doing quite a few interviews.
I'm a mid-level programmer and by no means the perfect interviewee, but 
with enough practice/repetition I became 
a better interviewee overtime and became more aware of the dynamics that take place which 
I haven't seen in a long time being away from interviews.

Throughout the slew of final interviews I went through at various companies, there were 
a few things that stood out when I could tell the interviewers were unprepared.

**1. They asked for a copy of my resume.**  No they weren't testing me if I was prepared
and brought copies to the interview.  When I handed my resume to them, they had this 
hurried look on their face that said, *"Let's see what's interesting here,"* or *"
What's a good question to ask about from this resume?"*  You could literally tell that
it was their first time seeing the resume.  

I noticed this more from C-level officers at startups.  They're startups, so I'm 
sure they didn't have much time or manpower to devote -- but still, it was a flag for me.

**2. They would ask outright BS questions.** I noticed this from the same interviewers who
gave me the impression that they've never seen my resume.  Since 
they already lack information about what's on my resume, they naturally gravitated to 
asking questions that wouldn't expose their ill-preparedness.  

These questions are the ones that would make your mind react with *"What the hell? 
Are you really asking that? You can do better than that".*  And my mind did react like that.
 Nonetheless, I still gave my answers to them.
However, my only **regret is that I didn't ask the questions back as a courtesy** -- 
and this is how you determine if a question is fair or if it's silly and embellished in corporate jargon. For example...

* ***What did you dislike about your previous job?*** This question has "It's a trap!" written 
all over it since it already assumes that there were things you disliked about your ex-employer
and that you're supposed to unleash the dirty dishes.  If one were to ask back the question, this would be 
*"What did you dislike about your ex-employees?"*  -- Is it obvious now how ridiculous it sounds?

* ***What are your 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses?*** Now imagine you ask back, *"What is your
company's (or the interviewer's) 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses?*" Sounds silly to me.


Remember, it's always a courtesy to ask the same questions back in a healthy business 
relationship. They could have gotten much better mileage from simpler questions, *"How was working for X?"*, *"What was your last project like?"*, or *"How was your day?"*. It could just be me, but BS questions being asked for a
mid-level position just grinds my gears.


**On the contrary,** there were a couple of hiring managers that impressed me with their preparation. One
hiring manager mentioned a cheesey line from my spiel written on my website; suffice it to say hearing it made me laugh
because I was caught off-guard... and that it was really cheesey.


What impressed me most was that she inquired further on a project displayed on my site.  This proved
that in addition to reading up on my resume, she also looked at my site -- a process that would have taken no more than
10 minutes for any hiring manager.
