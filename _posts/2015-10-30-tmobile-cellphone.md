So you're interested in maximizing your T-mobile $30 prepaid plan. Here's the down-low...

**What you have:**

1. Unlimited Data -- wherein the first 5GB is at 4G LTE speed, and anything after is 2G speed.

2. Unlimited Texting

3. 100 Minutes of Talk Time -- any minute that exceeds is billed at 10 cents.


As you can see from the above, items 1 and 2 should never be a problem. It's item 3 that can be tricky.  Below are the tips I use to go around it.

**How to Maximize:** 

1. **Accept the reality** that there would be months when you will exceed 100 minutes of talk time. -- Some months you tend to talk more, for example, during the holidays. By accepting this fact, you will be more open-minded about all possible solutions.

2. **Always have an extra $10 load in your sim card.** Since there would be months when you will go over your talk time, the best you could is to be prepared by carrying some extra amount in your account. If you exceed by 30 minutes, that's an extra 3 dollars. If you exceed by 1 hour, that's only 6 dollars. Paying $33 or $36 in one month is still cheaper than the $40, $50, or $60 plans. 

3. **Install Google's Hangout App and Hangout Dialer App on your phone.** Google Hangout allows you to make free outgoing calls with a U.S. or Canada area code.  You can also make free phone calls via your Gmail that uses Google Hangout.  I use Google Hangouts especially when calling credit card companies, doctors, and the like.

4. **Install Whatsapp.** Whatsapp allows free calls to anyone in the world as long as the recipient is also using Whatsapp.  

5. **Buy your refill card from grocery stores.** Well, this suggestion only works if you have a credit card that gives you cashback from grocery stores.  My current credit card gives me 3% cashback.


Well, if you made it this far, send me a text message and ask for what else I have in store for you!
