    <p><strong>Practicing Practice.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve decided to blog things that I have experienced; hence, practiced practice. There are two ways to learn according to “Stumbling on Happiness.” One is through coaching where things are taught to you. The other is through practice where you discover on your own. This blog focuses on the latter.</p>

<p>For my first post, I’m going to talk about my squats. I’ve always been athletic, and I’ve always enjoyed sports and physical activities. It wasn’t until about 9 months ago that I’ve discovered linear progression through Starting Strength and 5/3/1 books.</p>

<p>Since this March, I’ve been trying to improve my form on Squats so I can go about doing linear progression. And it wasn’t until recently that an “expert” (Jonnie Candito) gave me feedback that my squat form is “perfect.”</p>

<p>For the longest time, I’ve been reading and reading. However, it wasn’t until recently that I started looking at myself closely by video recording my squats. I feel that part of improving and bettering one’s form is to find ways to look at one’s self with an unbiased eye. And there is some truth when they say that you cannot judge yourself properly while you’re in the situation. This is true especially when doing squats. Looking at your reflection in the mirror while squatting will not help because you’re too distracted by the reflection while doing the motion.</p>

<p>Also, trusting one’s gut feeling is important. I started 9 months ago doing low-bar squats as preached by Starting Strength. However, I developed some knee pain. I decided to stray away from the bible and researched high-bar squats. Fast forward to today, my form is spot on and I’m squatting heavy. Well, heavy enough for my goal is to go to 300 lbs.</p>

<p>The big takeaway from this Squatting experience is that finding ways to look and reflect on myself honestly — not overtly critical to deliberately summon motivation and not overtly praising to cajole my ego — just straight and honest assessment of myself.</p>
