## July Note...

I've looked into investing pretty heavily about 5 years ago.  I wish I made notes of the terms that ought to be remembered and the approach I followed.  Oh well, it's not too late to refresh my memory and make notes.  So here goes...


It's 2014.  The approach I'll be using is making my portfolio.  

First off, reading...

1. I Will Teach You To Be Rich -- as far as investing is concerned, you cannot beat the market and you're better off investing in index funds because of the low fees.

## November Note...
Since I've been procrastinating  reading those fun reads mentioned above, I just went straight to the meat and bones.
The first resource I went to was [reddit's /r/personalfinance sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).
Here's the plan of action:

###1. Emergency Fund
This is typically the basic Savings Account.  It's a fund where you can easily take money from (i.e.,
not getting penalized) for the unexpecteds: job loss, appliance replacement,
medical procedures, unexpected travel, and more.

**What's the ideal size for an emergency fund?** If you're already an expert in your career (i.e., you're
sought-after), a fund for 6-months of expenses will work.  However, if you feel you're
in the early stages of your career (i.e., a lot of uncertainties), a fund for 12 months of expenses
is a good bet.

**What kinds of accounts should an emergency fund in be?**  Emergency funds should be held in safe investments
that can be liquidated in a hurry -- Savings & Checking account, CDs (Certificate of Deposits), and I-bonds.

Another good way letting your money work for you is to have the E-Fund in tiers as seen below, 
so you can take advantage of the higher interest rates that some accounts offer. 

* Tier 1: Checking account -- holds 2 month worth of expenses. 
* Tier 2: Savings account -- holds 4 month worth of expenses.
* Tier 3: CDs and I-bonds -- holds 6-12 month worth of expenses. (These accounts  
require a minimum number of months (e.g., 6) before the interest is earned.)



###2. Higher Education Expenses


###3. Employer-sponsored matching funds
