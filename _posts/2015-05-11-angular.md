## Why Angular?

If you're using JavaScript to create a dynamic website, Angular is a good choice.

* Angular helps you organize your JavaScript
* Angular helps create responsive (as in fast) websites
* ~~Angular plays well with jQuery~~
* Angular is easy to test
* Angular is "responsive" -- only requests the information it needs (hence; no need to load an entire page)
* Modern API-Driven Application -- like the one being built in the code school course


## What is Angular JS?

A client-side JavaScript Framework for adding interactivity to HTML.

**Directives** is used to tell our HTML when to trigger our JavaScript.  We add behavior to our HTML through Directives.  It is how we bind the behavior. (I know, I know. You get it!)

**Modules**

* Where we write pieces of our Angular application, and keep our code encapsulated.
* Makes our code more maintainable, testable, and readable.
* Where we define dependencies for our app.

**Expressions** allow you to insert dynamic values into your HTML. `{{ }}`

**Controllers** are where we define our app's behavior by defining functions and values. The scope of the controller is inside the DOM element it's attached to.

<!-- Defaul Backbone `parse` just returns response, so we edit it like so...

    var TodoItem = Backbone.Model.extend({
      parse: function(response){
    return response.todo; }
    });
