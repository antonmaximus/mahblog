<p>I injured my shoulder doing <a href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralClavicular/DBInclineBenchPress.html">dumbbell incline bench press</a> about a year and a half ago due to the rookie mistake of not focusing on my form and not listening to my body on how much load it should take.  This past Thanksgiving 2013, I’ve decided to stretch daily to help my injured right shoulder heal quicker.  As of today, I’m proud to say that I haven’t missed a day yet.</p>

<p>I follow <a href="http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html">Phraktured’s Starting Stretch</a> which I found on Reddit’s bodyweightfitness subforum. The stretching process involves 9 positions, covers various body parts (including shoulders), and takes about 15 minutes.  I’ve been doing this every morning for the past couple of months. I feel that my stretching routine is similar to how most people feel about their Starbucks coffee: the day is incomplete without one.</p>

<p>As for my injured right shoulder, it’s healing better and has now become more flexible.  Albeit, I now avoid heavy awkward exercises that can aggravate the injury, like bench pressing.</p>

<p>As for my future experiments with stretching… I recently discovered that <a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/mobility-recovery/two-new-studies-on-static-stretching-are-completely-conflicting">static stretching helps in sleep and that dynamic stretches are better prior to exercises</a>.  I’ll try these in the next month or two, and see how I feel about them.</p>
