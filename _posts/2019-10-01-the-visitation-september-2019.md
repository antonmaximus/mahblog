September 2019 sent me into deep saddening thoughts. This was mainly due to my medical school application. After finishing a slew of about 30 secondary applications from September, the application process finally took its toll on me since I was no longer busy and I had enough time to look at the body of work I put in for the past 2.5 years. I finally started wondering what I did wrong throughout my application: like low two MCAT tests, GPA that could have been a 3.60+, being pressured by online gunners to retake a decent MCAT test, secondary essays that could have been created better (Carle Illinois especially), getting sucked in by my Scribing Job that caused me to forget my path. Nonetheless, I also saw things that I did well: commitment to my community service and love to find a meaningful career.

I also had a few moments of revelation while doing my secondary: how I push my comfort zone, love for lifelong learning, and finally being at peace with HKN and how emotionally mature I was at that time (and a bad leader). I've also become more appreciative of my community service as a suicide phone counselor because it has helped me to emotionally grow and develop emotional skills. 

One thing that saved and kept my vitality is consistently going to the gym. Once I'm in the gym, I'm able to feel great for 1.5 hours through intense physically activity. I'm sure the hormones and endorphins are all helping me, but in a way it's given me enlightenment and a moment to emotionally, mentally, and spiritually heal. 
On another note, I also picked up chess at home to keep my mind pre-occupied. The only downside is that I got too addicted to playing chess that it has hampered my daily productivity. Took me 2 days to finish laundry that I've been putting off for months!

With that said, I finally had a moment of vindication with my medical school application! I got an interview with TCU and will be flying to Texas! Oh, and I also had my first random Daniel dream since his passing. I miss this guy a lot. I wish I was more appreciative when he was still around.
