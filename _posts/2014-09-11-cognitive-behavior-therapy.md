##Feelings

####Why do you feel the way you do?  

According to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, people feel emotionally bad for three reasons:

* They have a negative view of themselves as people;
* They interpret experiences in a negative and biased way; and
* They have a negative view of the future -- they expect everything to continue the way it is.

If this is true, this might also mean that happy people feel happy for the following reasons:

* They have a positive view of themselves as people;
* They interpret experiences in a positive and unbiased (or even positively biased) way; and
* They have a positive view of the future, they expect everything to continue the way it is.

####Identifying Negative Thoughts in People.  

Do they...

* Have a negative view of themselves as people?
* Have a negative biased view of situations?
* Feel negatively about the future?


#### Why think that way if it is so self-defeating?


Most depressed or anxious people do not like feeling unhappy, depressed or anxious. However, having a negative view of oneself, of the situation and of the future can become a habit. Depression or vulnerability to depression may come from too many years of holding wrong views of oneself as weak or unlovable, thinking in negative or biased ways, and knowing (or thinking one knows) that problems will continue in the future.


####Am I to blame if I feel bad?

No, not at all! Many factors contribute to feeling depressed and anxious. It is suggested that you might be able to protect yourself from some of these feelings by taking positive action to improve your thinking patterns and thereby changing your life.

#### What is lack of sadness or anxiety related to?

The good news is that you can be happy, even if you are as poor as the next person and you don’t have wonderful possessions, glamorous looks, fabulous clothes, a great job, icons and successes etc. The bad news is that you might need to work at developing skills which protect you against feeling depressed and anxious.

#### WUTIWUF

Changing your view about yourself, changing your thoughts about events and changing your view of the future will change the way you feel. This is a really simple idea but highly effective. Cognitive Therapy maintains that your emotions are strongly influenced by what you think. Negative emotions are caused by thinking negative (or warped) thoughts. Positive emotions are caused by thinking positive (or unwarped) thoughts.

What you think is what you feel is not a new strategy. Shakespeare, for example, gave Hamlet the following lines "There is neither good nor ill but thinking makes it so". Here he recognised that it is one’s interpretations of events rather than the quality of the event that determines their emotional impact.

#### Do the same thoughts result in the same feelings?

As you probably noticed by now, different feelings are often produced by different types of thoughts. For example, misery and depression usually arise from internal criticism (I’m hopeless, useless, unlovable, etc).

Anger is often produced by thinking that external situations should be better. For example, the world should work differently, life should be fairer, I should not be misjudged, it is not reasonable, they should understand my point of view, etc.

Anger is often only displayed where the person feels in a powerful position or at least in an equal position. For example, parents often get angry with children…people are reticent to get too grumpy at their boss (at least openly).

##Thoughts

#### David Burns’ Warped Thoughts 

**All or None Thinking.** Everything is perceived to be either full on or full off.  If something isn't fully completed, right, or perfect then it's entirely incomplete/wrong/spoiled.

**Overgeneralization.** One instance of a mistake/error is interpreted as a pattern of mistakes/errors.
