Nuts shoud be avoided for the following reasons:

**1. Phyctic Acid.** 

> Nuts contain a lot of phytic acid, AKA phytate, AKA IP-6, AKA the storage form of a plant’s phosphorus, and antioxidant to the seed in times of oxidative stress ([PDF](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=phytic%20acid%20longecity&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CGUQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjxb.oxfordjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F60%2F3%2F967.full.pdf&ei=O5uwT4GmCvHWiAK3qKC2BA&usg=AFQjCNEmbZukabHmMrUhfrKRRN6CItQNig&sig2=M_Ol1B0pz0NxZ1ptddSQ_w)). When something that contains it is eaten, phytic acid binds to minerals like zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium, chromium, and manganese in the gastrointestinal tract, unless it’s reduced or nullified by soaking, sprouting, and/or fermentation. Bound minerals generally cannot be absorbed in the intestine, and too many bound minerals can lead to mineral deficiencies. Animals who produce phytase – the enzyme that breaks down phytate – can thrive on phytate-rich foods. Rats, for example, produce ample amounts of phytase and can handle more dietary phytate without exhibiting signs of mineral deficiencies. Since humans produce around 30 times less phytase than rats, phytate-heavy diets might be problematic for humans. By dry weight, nuts generally contain more phytic acid than similar amounts of grains and legumes.

**2. Nuts are overrated foods in the "health community"**

Similar to dried fruits and protein bar in the health community, nuts are overrated.  People over do it
because it's labeled as "healthy."

> Nuts contain an incomplete amino acid profile and consist mostly of plant fats. The westernized diet is already highly unbalanced in the omega 3: omega 6-ratio—the polyunsaturated fats from nuts certainly won’t help.
