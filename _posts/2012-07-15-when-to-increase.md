Each set should be treated with proper attention.  In RPT (Reverse Pyramid Training), the very first set is known as the "top set" and you always want to max it out (i.e., go to failure).  And when you've surpassed your personal best (PB) for your top set, you then increase the weight.


As for the other sets, though their weight is a factor of the 1st set, they should be increased only if you've beaten your PB on them.  Here's a Q&A from Martin Berkhan's site:


**Q:** *Assuming you do a 60kg x 7 reps, 54kg x 8, 48kg x 9; it's following the take 10% off and increase 1 rep method. So once I hit say, 8 reps, and I increase my weight by 2.5% to 61.5kg, do my 2nd and 3rd sets remain constant at 54x8, 48x9? Or do I take 90%, 80% of 61.5kg?"*

**A:** *No, when you hit 8 reps in set 2 and/or 3, you increase those by 2.5% as well.*
