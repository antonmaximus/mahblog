## Resumes

* Your first resume is Google.  Organize what people find about you.
* Your purpose, for your pre-Google resume, is to get yourself invited in for an interview.
    * Focus all their attention, initially, on what you can do -- that you can perform all the tasks required in the job.  Save what you can't do for the moment when they say they really want you. 
    * You will need to weigh every sentence in it by one criterion and only one: Will this help get me invited in for an interview?
* No matter how skillfully your write your resume, some employers will like it, some won't.


# Where you Post your resumes make a difference

* If resumes came from job-boards, an employer would have to sift through 219 applications.
* If social media (like LinkedIn/Facebook) was used, 116 applications on average.
* Own website, 33 resumes.
* If resume came from pro-active applicants (e.g., no job posting, but cold-email anyway), 32.
* Referrals, 10 resumes.

The Lower the number, the more visibility you get.


Certain other facts about the job-hunt in this country never change. Here are ten of them, that have remained the same since the first edition of this book was published, and throughout the forty-two yearly editions since.


*     You must take charge of your own job-hunt, and determine not to conduct a traditional job-hunt (“this is the way it has always been done and must be done”), but rather, a creative one.
*     To do a creative job-hunt, there are three questions you must find out the answer to: they are What, Where and How. WHAT are your skills that you most love to use? WHERE would you most love to use these skills? (In terms of field, purpose of the company or organization, location, style of working, kinds of people you work with, etc.) And finally, HOW do you go about finding such places?
*     You must devote as much time to your job-hunt as you possibly can. If you want to devote as little time to your job-hunt as possible, then fine; try it. But if that doesn’t lead to a job, then you are going to have to devote more time to it.
*     If your job-hunt isn’t working, then you must take the time to find out as much up-to-date information as you possibly can about the job-hunt itself, and not just about the job-market. Effective job-hunting techniques keep evolving.
*     If your job-hunt isn’t working, then you must take the time to do a thorough survey of yourself before you do a survey of the job-market (like, finding out what are “the hot jobs”).
*     You must approach organizations, companies, or institutions that interest you, whether or not they have a known vacancy. Go after smaller, newer companies in particular. Sometimes vacancies develop in a day and a night, and do not immediately get advertised or published.
*      Job-hunting is not a science; it is an art. Some job-hunters know instinctively how to do it; in some cases, they were born knowing how to do it. Others of us sometimes have a harder time with it, but fortunately for us in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, there is help, coaching, counseling, and advice—online and off.
*     Job-hunting is always mysterious. Sometimes mind-bogglingly mysterious. You may never understand why things sometimes work, and sometimes do not.
*     There is no “always wrong” way to hunt for a job or to change careers. Anything may work under certain circumstances, or at certain times, or with certain employers. There are only degrees of likelihood of certain job-hunting techniques working or not working. But it is crucial to know that likelihood
*     There is no “always right” way to hunt for a job or to change careers. Anything may fail to work under certain circumstances, or at certain times, or with certain employers. There are only degrees of likelihood of certain job-hunting techniques working or not working. But it is crucial to know that likelihood, as we just saw. Job-hunting always depends on some amount of luck. Luck, pure luck. Having advanced job-hunting skills doesn’t mean absolutely, positively, you will always be able to find a job. It does mean that you can get good at reducing the amount that depends on luck, to as small a proportion as possible.

## Chapter 4: Interview Tips

**1. There is no such thing as 'employers'.** 
Don't get discouraged by your interview history.  Every "NO" you get out of the way, you're one step closer to YES.

**2. Be prepared and do some research.**

**3. Honor agreements, especially if you asked for the interview.**

**4. An interview for a job is at its best is just a conversation.**

> The other human activity job-hunting most resembles is dating, not marketing a used car.  This conversation is two people attempting to decide if you both want to "try going steady." 
> You use the interview to find out "Do I really want to work here?". You want to find out now, not three years in.

**5. Expect questions from them; expect to give questions to them.**

* Tell me about yourself. (Of course.)
* What do you know about this company?
* Why are you applying for this job?
* How would you describe yourself?
* What are your major strengths?
* What is your greatest weakness?
* What type of work do you like to do best?
* What are your interests outside of work?
* What accomplishment gave you the greatest satisfaction?
* Why did you leave your last job?
* Where do you see yourself five years from now?
* What are your goals in life?
* How much did you make at your last job?

There are only 5 basic questions that you need to pay attention to:

* Why are you here? -- Why are you knocking on my door,  rather than someone else's door?
* What can you do for us? -- If I were to hire you, will you help me with the challenges I face? What are your skills? How much do you know about the subject that we are in?
* What kind of person are you? -- Will you fit in? Do you have the kind of personality that makes it easy for people to work with you? Do you share the same values we have at this place?
* What exactly distinguishes you from nineteen other people who are applying for this job? -- Do you have better work habits than the other applicants? 
* Can I afford you? -- If we decide we want you here, how much will it take to get you and are we willing and able to pay that amount?

The 5 questions you should find out answers to:

* What does this job involve? -- You want to understand exactly what tasks will be asked of you, so that you can determine if these are the kinds of tasks you would really like to do.
* What are the skills a top employee in this job would have to have? -- You want to find out if your skills match those that the employer thinks a top employee in this job has to have.
* Are these the kind of people I would like to work with or not? -- Rely on your intuition.  You want to know if they have the kind of personalities that would enable you to accomplish your best work.  If these aren't it, keep looking!
* If we like each other, and we both want to work together, can I persuade them there is something unique about me that makes me different from other 19 applicants? 
* Can I persuade them to hire me at the salary I need or want?

    Further questions:

    * What significant changes has this company gone through in the past five years?
    * What values are sacred to this company?
    * What characterizes the most successful employees this company has?
    * What future changes do you see in the work here?
    * Who do you see as your allies, colleagues, or competitors in this business? 

**6. Observe the 50-50 Rule.** That both parties should be talking/listening with equal amounts of time.

**7. In answering questions, observe the "20 sec to 2 minute" rule.** Too short than that means you lack communication skills; too long you can lose their attention.

**8. The employer is primarily concerned about risk.**


**9. Prepare for both the dragon and the mosquitoes.**  It's the small things that are the killers in a job interview.  -- The best of interviewers operate intuitively on the principle of microcosm reveals macrocosm.  They scrutinize your past, as in your resume, for the same reason: microcosm (your behavior in the past) reveals macrocosm (your likely behavior in the future).

* Your appearance and personal habits.
* Nervous mannerisms -- Like eye contact, handshake, slouching.
* Lack of self-confidence -- Speaking softly, hesitantly, one-word answers, downplaying your achievements.
* The consideration you show to other people 
* Your values

**10. Be aware of the skills most employers are looking for regardless of the position you are seeking.**  -- Punctual, dependable, good-attitude, enthusiasm, looking for something more than a paycheck?

**11. Try to think of some way to bring evidence of your skills.**

**12. Do not bad mouth your previous employers.**


**13. Keep in mind, the employers don't really care about your past;** they only ask about it in order to try to predict your future behavior with them should they hire you.

> Employer's Question: "Tell me about yourself."
> 
> The Fear: The employer is afraid there is something wrong with you and is hoping you blurt it out."
> 
> 
> E.Q.: "What kind of job are you looking for?"
> 
> The Fear: The employer is afraid you are looking for a different job than that which they are trying to fill.


**14. As the interview proceeds, you want to quietly notice the timeframe of the questions the employer is asking.** It's a way of measuring how the interview is going.

**15. Before you leave the (final) interview,** assuming you have decided that you like them and maybe they like you, There are some questions you should always ask:

* Can you Offer me this job?
* When may I expect to hear from you?
* Might I ask what would be the latest I can expect to hear from you?

**16. Thank you notes must be sent after every interview. It makes a difference.**

## Chapter 5: The Six Secrets of Salary Negotiation

**1. Never discuss salary untl the end of the whole interviewing process at that Organization, and they have definitely said they want you.**


> Employer: "What kind of salary are you looking for?"
> 
> You #1: "Until you've decided you definitely want me, and I've decided I definitely could help you with your tasks and projects here, I feel any discussion of salary is premature."
> 
> You #2: "I'll gladly answer that, but could you first help me understand what this job involves?"
> 
> You #3: "I'm looking for a salary in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 a year."

**2. The purpose of salary negotiation is to uncover the most that an employer is willing to pay to get you.**

**3. During salary discussion, never be the first one to mention a salary figure.**  Whoever mentions a salary figure first, generally loses the negotiation in the end.  ("Lose" is subjective here because you're still winning with a new job.)

**4. Before you go to the interview, do some careful research on typical salaries for your field and in that organization.**

* http://www.bls.gov/ooh/
* http://stats.bls.gov/oes/oes_emp.htm

**5. Research the range that the employer likely has in mind, and then define an interrelated range for yourself, relative to the employer's range.** I.e., compare what the person who would be below you make and what the person who would be above you makes.

**6. Know how to bring the salary negotiation to a close; don't leave it "just hanging."**  (Get the new figure in writing and check the fringe benefits.)
