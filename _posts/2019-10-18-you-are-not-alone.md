Dear Jojet of the internet, stop chasing people who are not fully available for you—emotionally, physically, and mentally. You deserve better. 

You're a beautiful person who's taken care of yourself really well. After all, you wouldn't have reached this age you're in now if you never consistently took care of yourself. So why not push this genuine self-care further? Find people who can be there for you emotionally, physically, mentally, and spiritually just as you've always been for yourself.

"Protect yourself, shield yourself." Something I want to tell myself when I'm circling around using apps to chase that phantom person. 

Be a quality person, and you'd find yourself in the presence of quality people—regardless if it's friendship, romance, or career.
