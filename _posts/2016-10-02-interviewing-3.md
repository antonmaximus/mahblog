## What Worked

* You weren't afraid to fail in phone screens, coding challenges, and in-person interviews. You face them and fail better. 
* Resume gets the phone calls. Phone calls and coding challenge get you onsite. Onsite interview is how two future teammates get to know each other.
* Studying over the long term. 
* Excitement about coding challenges.
* Arriving ahead of time, and checking parking/driving instructions.
* Having inquisitive questions about your future teammates.
* Acknowledging and reading your teammates.


## What Didn't

* Self-expression. Find how to "express" yourself in all aspects: the way you move, talk, dress, and communicate.
