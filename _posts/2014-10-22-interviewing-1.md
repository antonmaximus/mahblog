## What Worked

* You were excited -- this made you alert and attentive.


## What Didn't

* You were too excited like a kid -- one who's looking to add a person is looking to
solve issues and not take care of one.
* You were not calm -- the need to be composed and interested at the same time
* You were not prepared -- you went to the interview on a 24 hour notice and didn't spend 
much time reading.
* Your website didn't showcase enough of you -- add projects you've completed.
* Being funny.


## Always:

### Before
* Get Interview Itinerary -- This should include:
  * People whom you'll be talking to and their background.
  * Duration of each interview
  * Type of interview (e.g., technical, group, one-on-one)
* Have questions ready
* Preparation is key, so read up
  * Industry the team is in.
  * Key people.
  * The team's previous products.
  * Be very wary of interviews with less than 2 days notice -- not enought time to prepare

### During
* Be Grounded -- *To me, being grounded means being fully present: physically, emotionally and energetically. It means your mind is not wandering or pulling your energy elsewhere. Your heart and soul are not searching somewhere in the past or looking into the future. (Take a deep breath ... there, you're grounded!)*
  * Breathe and listen to yourself.
* Be calm and composed  -- You want the other party to be composed? You should start it.
* Interact, Connect, and Improv -- with anyone and everyone.
  * Ask your favorite question at each interview (even if it's repetitive to you, each
  person will have a different take on it).
* Improv rule: Avoid being funny.  Humor comes naturally and we want clever lines.


### After
* Expect that they're also interviewing other people -- This means you're not that 
special.  And that even if you did really well to the best of your ability, they'd 
still go with someone who's done it better than you did (so it may not be all you after all).
* There will be a waiting game.  Don't play it by focusing on more important items on your to-do list.



### Looking back from a 2016 Oct POV....

There was no connection. "Why?", you asked. Here's why:

* You whined about that former "the guy"
* You fabricated about that "salon"

Be candid. Be associated with positive feelings/stories.
