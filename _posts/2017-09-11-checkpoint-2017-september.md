## I've lost Track. Sadly.

Three years ago was the last time I tracked my squats and deadlifts. It's not until 
now that I've decided to blog it again. I failed at tracking myself, but am now picking it up
back again.

### A workaround: Keep it simple stupid. Keep things lean. Embrace Yourself. Own it. 

I've accepted the fact that it's a spiral path, things are not linear, and things
are more cyclical. I've noticed
the past 2 years that every summer, I would always not want to lift hard. I'm not sure
if it was the summer bug or just the heat, but my best lifts have always been in the 
fall. Now, I plan to take summers off, so am not too stressed too much and prepare for
fall lifting. 


To make things simpler, I've decided to do 1 rep maxes for my squats and deadlifts. 
Below are my PRs for this September 2017. They're significanlty lower than my lifts 
from 2016 Spring.
