How do you take a conversation from 1 minute to 10 minutes? From them feeling 'I like that person' to the point 'I'm willing to help that person'?  When you've actually made a serious connection? 


Two Parts to having an awesome connection

1. A jovial, light-hearted, funny, silly conversation

2. Relating to people a bit more about your values.


Three mindsets that cover the 2 parts above:

1. Spread conversational ammo -- gives the other person many options to relate to. It builds the world.  Provide specifics.

2. Just say it out.  Don't discriminate about the ammo you put out there.  -- filtering leads to internal discomfort. You don't need to have a master plan.

3. Activate your body -- Identify your emotions and consciously show it through voice, body, etc.

    * Forward-staggered stance to open up people in their personal spaces -- it's like avoiding blocking on theatre stage.

    * Make a habit of using emotions & body language to talk to people.  Smile. Show your emotions.

    * Experiment ona big body expression each week. Gesticulate!


The best conversationalists don't know where they're going all the time, but they seem to find their way in genious ways because they put so much out there.
