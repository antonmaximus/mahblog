In progress...

Why do I get excited or taken over when someone shows interest?

The emotional brain (limbic system) evolved first before the thinking brain (neocortex); thus, it is more established. Furthermore, the pathway from your senses to the thalamus to the limbic system is much faster/shorter than the pathway from the senses to the thalamus to the neocortex; thus, the impulse triggers a faster response. With these 2 wirings, we don't stand a chance.

If an average american has a below average Emotional Intelligence, putting them in a position where their emotional senses will be easily aroused will definitely trigger them. They are ticking time bombs. The best way to prevent them (and myself) from going off is by not putting themselves in a position where they can be emotionally triggered (eg., fear, lust, etc.).


Important notes:
- Left prefrontal cortex dampens down all but the strongest negative surges of emotion coming from the limbic system. The key “off switch” for distressing emotion seems to be the left prefrontal lobe.
- HARMONIZING EMOTION AND THOUGHT: 
 - The connections between the amygdala (and related limbic structures) and the neocortex **are the hub of the battles or cooperative treaties struck between head and heart, thought and feeling.** This circuitry explains why emotion is so crucial to effective thought, both in mak- ing wise decisions and in simply allowing us to think clearly. That is why when we are emotionally upset we say we "just can't think straight" — and why continual emotional distress can create deficits in a child's intellectual abilities, crippling the capacity to learn.

 - Despite their intellectual potential, these are the children at highest risk for problems like academic failure, alcoholism, and criminality — not because their intellect is deficient, but because their control over their emotional life is impaired.

- he prefrontal-amygdala circuit is a crucial doorway to the repository for the likes and dislikes we acquire over the course of a lifetime. 

-The emotions, then, matter for rationality. Likewise, the thinking brain plays an executive role in our emotions—except in those mo- ments when emotions surge out of control and the emo- tional brain runs rampant. In a sense we have two brains, two minds — and two different kinds of intelligence: rational and emotional. How we do in life is determined by both—it is not just IQ, but emotional intelligence that matters.

- This turns the old understanding of the tension between reason and feeling on its head: it is not that we want to do away with emotion and put reason in its place, as Erasmus had it, but instead find the intelligent balance of the two. The old paradigm held an ideal of reason freed of the pull of emotion. **The new paradigm urges us to harmonize head and heart.** To do that well in our lives means we must first understand more exactly what it means to use emotion intelligently.

Living an intelligent life is harmonizing both head and heart. 


Part 2:

What does this mean: The brightest among us can founder on the shoals of unbridled passions and unruly impulses; people with high IQs can be stunningly poor pilots of their private lives.


EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DESTINY: 
academic intelligence offers virtually no preparation for the turmoil—or opportun- ity—life's vicissitudes bring. Yet even though a high IQ is no guarantee of prosperity, prestige, or happiness in life, our schools and our culture fixate on academic abilities, ignoring emotional intelligence, a set of traits—some might call it character—that also matters immensely for our personal destiny.
-Consider also data from an ongoing study of eighty- one valedictorians and salutatorians from the 1981 class in Illinois high schools. Ten years after graduating from high school, only one in four were at the highest level of young people of comparable age in their chosen profession, and many were doing much less well.


A DIFFERENT KIND OF INTELLIGENCE
- Gardner rocks. Gardner's model pushes way beyond the standard concept of IQ as a single, immutable factor. Gardner acknowledges that seven is an arbitrary fig- ure for the variety of intelligences. Project Spectrum. The Spectrum scores give parents and teachers clear guidance about the realms that these children will take a spontaneous interest in, and where they will do well enough to develop the passions that could one day lead beyond proficiency to mastery.
- Gardner gave these nutshell sum- maries of the personal intelligences:
Inter personal intelligence is the ability to under- stand other people: what motivates them, how they work, how to work cooperatively with them. Successful salespeople, politicians, teachers, clini- cians, and religious leaders are all likely to be indi- viduals with high degrees of interpersonal intelli- gence, Intrapersonal intelligence . . . is a correlat- ive ability, turned inward. It is a capacity to form an accurate, veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life.
- In another rendering, Gardner noted that the core of interpersonal intelligence includes the "capacities to discern and respond appropriately to the moods, tem- peraments, motivations, and desires of other people." In intra-personal intelligence, the key to self-knowledge, he included "access to one's own feelings and the ability to discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behavior.

SPOCK VS. DATA WHEN COGNITION IS NOT ENOUGH
Emotions enrich; a model of mind that leaves them out is impoverished.

CAN EMOTIONS BE INTELLIGENT?
Salovey subsumes Gardner's personal intelligences in his basic definition of emotional intelligence, expanding these abilities into five main domains:
1. Knowing one's emotions.
**People with greater certainty about their feelings are better pilots of their lives, having a surer sense of how they really feel about personal decisions from whom to marry to what job to take.**
2. Managing emotions. Handling feelings so they are appropriate is an ability that builds on self-awareness.
3. Motivating oneself.
4. Recognizing emotions in others. 
5. Handling relationships. 


IQ AND EMOTIONS INTELLIGENCE: PURE TYPES
Jack Block, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, has made a comparison of two theoretical pure types: people high in IQ versus people high in emotional aptitudes.15 The dif- ferences are telling.
The high-IQ pure type (that is, setting aside emotional intelligence) is almost a caricature of the intellectual, adept in the realm of mind but inept in the personal world. The profiles differ slightly for men and women.

The high-IQ male is typified—no surprise—by a wide range of intellectual interests and abilities. He is ambi- tious and productive, predictable and dogged, and un- troubled by concerns about himself. He also tends to be critical and condescending, fastidious and inhibited, un- easy with sexuality and sensual experience, unexpress- ive and detached, and emotionally bland and cold.

By contrast, men who are high in emotional intelli- gence are socially poised, outgoing and cheerful, not prone to fearfulness or worried rumination. They have a notable capacity for commitment to people or causes, for taking responsibility, and for having an ethical out- look; they are sympathetic and caring in their relation- ships. Their emotional life is rich, but appropriate; they are comfortable with themselves, others, and the social universe they live in.

Purely high-IQ women have the expected intellectual confidence, are fluent in expressing their thoughts, value intellectual matters, and have a wide range of in- tellectual and aesthetic interests. They also tend to be introspective, prone to anxiety, rumination, and guilt, and hesitate to express their anger openly (though they do so indirectly).

Emotionally intelligent women, by contrast, tend to be assertive and express their feelings directly, and to feel positive about themselves; life holds meaning for them. Like the men, they are outgoing and gregarious, and ex- press their feelings appropriately (rather than, say, in outbursts they later regret); they adapt well to stress. Their social poise lets them easily reach out to new people; they are comfortable enough with themselves to be playful, spontaneous, and open to sensual experi- ence. Unlike the women purely high in IQ, they rarely feel anxious or guilty, or sink into rumination.

These portraits, of course, are extremes—all of us mix IQ and emotional intelligence in varying degrees. But they offer an instructive look at what each of these di- mensions adds separately to a person's qualities.


# 4 Know Thyself

Socrates's injunction "Know thyself speaks to this keystone of emotional intelligence: awareness of one's own feelings as they occur.
It might seem at first glance that our feelings are obvious; more thoughtful reflection reminds us of times we have been all too oblivious to what we really felt about something, or awoke to these feelings late in the game.

Psychologists use the rather ponderous term metacog- nition to refer to an awareness of thought process, and metamood to mean awareness of one's own emotions. I prefer the term self-awareness, in the sense of an ongoing attention to one's internal states.

This awareness of emotions is the fundamental emotional competence on which others, such as emotional self-control, build. Self-awareness, in short, means being "aware of both our mood and our thoughts about that mood."

Although there is a logical distinction between being aware of feelings and acting to change them, Mayer finds that for all practical purposes the two usually go hand-in-hand: to recognize a foul mood is to want to get out of it. This recognition, however, is distinct from the efforts we make to keep from acting on an emotional im- pulse. When we say "Stop that!" to a child whose anger has led him to hit a playmate, we may stop the hitting, but the anger still simmers. The child's thoughts are still fixated on the trigger for the anger—"But he stole my toy!"—and the anger continues unabated. Self-aware- ness has a more powerful effect on strong, aversive feel- ings: the realization "This is anger I'm feeling" offers a greater degree of freedom—not just the option not to act on it, but the added option to try to let go of it.

Mayer finds that people tend to fall into distinctive styles for attending to and dealing with their emotions:

• Self-aware. Aware of their moods as they are having them, these people understandably have some sophistication about their emotional lives. Their clarity about emotions may undergird other personality traits: they are autonomous and sure of their own boundaries, are in good psychological health, and tend to have a positive outlook on life. When they get into a bad mood, they don't ruminate and obsess about it, and are able to get out of it sooner. In short, their mindfulness helps them manage their emotions.
• Engulfed. These are people who often feel swamped by their emotions and helpless to escape them, as though their moods have taken charge. They are mer- curial and not very aware of their feelings, so that they are lost in them rather than having some perspective. As a result, they do little to try to escape bad moods, feeling that they have no control over their emotional life. They often feel overwhelmed and emotionally out of control.
• Accepting. While these people are often clear about what they are feeling, they also tend to be accepting of their moods, and so don't try to change them. There seem to be two branches of the accepting type: those who are usually in good moods and so have little motiv- ation to change them, and people who, despite their clarity about their moods, are susceptible to bad ones but accept them with a laissez-faire attitude, doing nothing to change them despite their distress—a pattern found among, say, depressed people who are resigned to their despair.

THE MAN WITHOUT FEELINGS
As Henry Roth observed in his novel Call It Sleep about this power of language, "If you could put words to what you felt, it was yours." The corollary, of course, is the alexithymic's dilemma: having no words for feelings means not making the feelings your own.



IN PRAISE OF GUT FEELING
The intuitive signals that guide us in these moments come in the form of limbic-driven surges from the vis- cera that Damasio calls "somatic markers"—literally, gut feelings. The somatic marker is a kind of automatic alarm, typically calling attention to a potential danger from a given course of action. More often than not these markers steer us away from some choice that experi- ence warns us against, though they can also alert us to a **golden opportunity**.

The key to sounder personal decision-making, in short: being attuned to our feelings.
