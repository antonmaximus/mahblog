Happy Birthday Li'l Brother!  

I had a random thought today. For the longest time, I failed at getting a good 
physique. It wasn't until I focused on building strength and executing
with proper form that I noticed gains. In some ways, I feel I may have been 
focusing on superficial in my other parts of life. 

Am I failing in finding a good career because I was focusing on the prestige? 
An engineer at Lucasfilm? A nice paycheck? Wow. Why not look into job fulfillment? How many people 
you interact with or directly help? Maybe prestige is just a bonus item similar 
to aesthetics. 

Am I failing in finding a good relationship because I was focusing on the person's looks?
Their innocence/mileage? Why not look into their habits and see if they do the same
things that are of interest to me? Maybe meet their friends and see
if you can get a better overall view of that person?
