## What Worked

* You practiced courage in taking a high-stake, anxiety-inducing situation.
* You studied for the short-term.


## What Didn't

* You weren't ready... like long-term ready.  There are things that you can review up on in the imminent term, and then there are things that could only be learned in the long-term.
* Scheduled the talk a tad bit earlier than your normal functioning hours.
* You didn't effuse and laugh.
