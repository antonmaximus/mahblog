Body recomposition is 70% diet and 30% training. I've heard arguments that the division is more close to 85% and 15%.  In any case, the point of the matter is: Diet plays a huge role compared to training.

If you haven't figured out what your diet should be, you better do that first before figuring out how your training or exercise routines should be.  You're better off spending your one hour in the kitchen and preparing a healthy meal for the entire day, than spending one hour in the gym and eating crap afterwards.  In my opinion, the order of importance is sleep (rest), eat, then training (S.E.T.).

This blog goes over the remaining 30% of your body composition -- a.k.a. the training part.  And this 30% will only be effective if you already have the 70% all figured out.
