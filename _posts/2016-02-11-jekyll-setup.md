Two things I found out in configuring Jekyll

1. I can publish posts [without having it linked on the homepage](http://kellysutton.com/2015/02/18/public-drafts-with-jekyll.html).

2. A post's url can be customized [if you edit the permalink](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8664675/how-to-customize-jekylls-url).
