Failed again. However, it's due to injury. Lower back started hurting in January/February, which I assessed as chornic injury. I could only speculate at this point and I believe it's due to a combination of factors: high chronic stress due to MCAT, poor sleep for weeks (due to MCAT also), poor diet for weeks (tried eating all of my calories in one sitting to save time for MCAT studying), lack of sun during winter, and lack of cardio. I stopped doing all kinds of squats and deadlifts in March, and have only been doing lunges and my back has been slowly healing. 

Today, I tried a couple of very light front squats and there's still some very minor tenderness on the lower right back. I feel it's healing, albeit slowly. After doing the squats, I noticed that I could lessen the back discomfort when I have my lower back inline with the weight -- thereby, having the center of mass of the bar right above it. This is something for me to practice once I'm back in lifting mode. 

Next Goal: enroll in Olympic Weightlifing class.
