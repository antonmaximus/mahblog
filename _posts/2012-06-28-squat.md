Why we point our knee out: [Video](https://youtu.be/xvutyUKHvSA?t=6m20s) @6:20 -- what happens when we drop the knees in.



Example: [Zach Squats](https://vimeo.com/10055310)


Learning to Squat:


1. Generate Hip Drive
2. Adding the Bar (to the correct position):
    * Thumbs on top of the bar
      * so that the wrists can be held in a straight line with the forearms.
    * Correct shoulder placement
      * The bar is just under the spine of the scapula.
    * Just above the posterior delt

3. Leverage and Moment -- the basis of Barbell Training
    * Similarities in the images below: The force comes from a distance where the fulcrum (stationary object) is.
    * Differences: The body is more complex, so the bar is lifted as the upper body goes up.

### The Important Things You're Going to Do Wrong:

*Depth:* You're probably going to squat to a position above parallel. This will occur because you're not looking down, you're not shoving your knees out, you have a stance that is either too narrow or too wide, or you have not committed to going deep.


*Knee position:* You will fail to shove your knees out as you start down. This will make correct depth hard to attain and will kill your hip drive.


*Stance:* Your stance will be either too narrow or too wide, with your toes usually pointed too forward. This will result in a squat that is not below parallel.


*Eye gaze:* You will fail to look down. This will kill your hip drive.


*Back angle:* Your back will (usually) be too vertical, due to a faulty mental picture of what your hips do when you squat or due to the incorrect placement of the bar on your back, or your back will be too horizontal, due to your failure to keep your chest up. Either error will adversely affect hip drive and depth.


*Hip drive:* You will lift your chest instead of driving your hips up. This will kill your power out of the bottom by making your back angle too vertical.


*Bar placement:* You will place the bar too high on your back. This will adversely affect your back angle and your hip drive.


*Rack height:* You will set the bar in the rack in a position that is too high. This will make the preferred position on the back difficult to attain.




Common Problems Everyone Should Know How to Solve

3. Hips
4. Knees
    * Shove 'em forward and out (i.e., don't close them together)
5. Feet and Stance
6. The Master Cue
7. Breathing
