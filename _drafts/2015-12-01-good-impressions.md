The scope of this post is for both good impressions and first impressions.  

## Mindset

Wrong Mindset: 
 * *How can I impress this person?*  OR *How can I make them like me?* -- name dropper, or trying to cram all cool things.
 * The **unworthy mindset** -- Feeling inferior when interacting with someone they perceive of high status. This leads to "locking-up" one's self.


# If it's not about being impressive, what is it all about? 
* To **evoke** a certain emotional response in that person, and have them **tie those emotions** to you.
* People are going to decide to date you, be friends with you, work with you based on **how you make them feel**.
