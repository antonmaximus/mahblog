    <h1 id="looking-for-a-good-place-to-live-in-los-angeles">Looking for a good place to live in Los Angeles:</h1>

<p>When I moved to Los Angeles, I wanted to find a place to live that would have all the things that I might need: close to the west side where the tech jobs are, not costly, good roommate(s).  With all these requirements that were equally important to me, finding a listing was very limited.</p>

<p>I knew that finding roommates that meet all these criteria would take time.  My main avenue of finding listings was online, of course, and I brute force my way through it.  I regularly checked listings on Craigslist, and after sometime, I noticed that most of the  places that had the price range I was looking for was in the Palms area.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, I’ve met a lot of people and in some ways have sharpened my skill in reading people if they would be a good match for me.  Finally, on one rainy day, I met two guys that shared some similarities with me: college-educated from a big school, sports-minded, and was open to me leaving in 6 months if things don’t work out.  We hit it off right off the bat the first time we met.</p>

<p>It took me 4 months to finally find them. And if it weren’t for me persistently staying the course of regularly checking and actively meeting people, I wouldn’t have found them.</p>

<p>I ended up finding a place that was $725 a month, 6 miles to the Silicon Beach (tech area), central to most of LA, and 2 awesome roommates.</p>

<h1 id="deciding-if-los-angeles-would-be-a-good-city-for-me">Deciding if Los Angeles would be a good city for me:</h1>

<p>I have been living in San Rafael (North California) for a year and a half when my job at Lucasfilm ended due to layoffs.  I knew I wanted to get out of NorCal because of the weather mostly, but at the same time I wanted to ensure that the new city I had in mind – which was Los Angeles – was definitely not another NorCal in terms of the weather.</p>

<p>I started by casually talking with various people within my vicinity – coworkers, roommates, and strangers/neighbors – to see if they had experience living in Los Angeles.  Those that did, I further pried more information on how the weather was like in LA.  I remember talking to my coworker Nate and hearing him say that he would let his jeep be uncovered overnight and its inside would still be alright, which he could not do in NorCal.  This definitely gave me some insight that Los Angeles could be the warm-weathered city I was looking for.</p>

<p>A more quantitative approach I took was to compare the monthly temperature averages between cities that I have lived in and Los Angeles – the city I was considering living in. I graphed the average monthly highs and lows for Los Angeles versus San Rafael, Orlando, and  Austin. And based on the graph, its temperatures were more ideal for me compared to the cities I have lived in.</p>

<p>Using the data and the personal stories I’ve gathered,  I decided that I would be moving to Los Angeles because I knew it was the city that was inline with the weather that I value.</p>

<h1 id="on-how-i-decided-ut-austin-was-the-right-school-for-me">On how I decided UT Austin was the right school for me</h1>

<p>I’ve always wanted to do big things when I was a young adult: make money, buy a car, get a degree from a big school.  I already decided then that I wanted to pursue engineering (more on that in another story), but which school did I really want to attend?  I got the grades, but did I have the money and ability to move to another city? If so, how would I decide which school?</p>

<p>Since I was in Texas, it was apparent to me that I would make use of my Texas residency status to further my education.  And to make my education inexpensive, I would have to go to a state school.  The biggest schools I could think of at that time were Texas A&amp;M University, UT Austin, and UT Dallas.  All of these schools came up after various conversations with the people around me: coworkers, classmates, and college counselors from Collin County Community College which was the college I was attending.</p>

<p>I compared the location of the schools as well and what their cities would offer. Austin seemed very interesting to me at that time from both reading online and talking to people; I viewed it quite vibrant at that time. Nonetheless, I knew I was after an education, so this option had not much on weight on it.</p>

<p>Then, I compared the rankings of the universities and the rankings of their respective engineering schools. It was clear cut that UT Austin was the leading public university in Texas and also the leading engineering public school in Texas.</p>

<p>All of the comparison I had (people feedback, location, and rankings) were pointing towards to UT. Hence, the decision to choose UT was too much of a battle. Though, in retrospect, Texas A&amp;M would have been a pretty similar good decision.  Boy did I love attending UT.</p>

<h1 id="that-time-when-you-chose-to-be-in-engineering">That time when you chose to be in Engineering</h1>

<p>One of my goals was to attend and finish college. The hump in the road was, “what degree?”.</p>

<p>I looked back on my past actions and tried to figure out what I excelled in. Looking back on my consistent performance in the Philippines, it was math and science.</p>

<p>Also, before I moved to the US, I already spent a couple of years at a local Manila university in Engineering. I got into it more by chance because I was surrounded by high school friends that pursued engineering afterwards. Hence, when I moved to the US, I tried to continue something that I was already doing: pursuing an engineering career.</p>

<p>Having these 2 attributes – being great in Math/Science and already indoctrinated to engineering – getting a degree in engineering seemed attractive at that time.</p>

<h1 id="a-time-when-i-got-out-of-a-depression">A time when I got out of a depression</h1>

<p>I’ve been in several depression states throughout my 35 years of being alive. One of my most memorable one was when I moved to the states when I was 19-20.  I wanted to be able to end my sadness and jump start to a new life in Texas.  The only thing that was holding me back from living fully was depression.</p>

<p>No one knew of my sadness. I would cry in the bathroom while looking at the memorabilia that I took with me from the Philippines.  I would also cry myself to sleep at night.  However, I still managed to be around with other people happily. Some might call it “showing a face,” but I did feel I wanted to be happy/positive while around people – I guess, this is some sign of being an extrovert.</p>

<p>I also actively continued day-to-day activities: going to work, talking to people, exploring classes/schools, watching Friends, and more. I did these while deep inside I was still saddened of losing my friends.</p>

<p>Finally, after a year and seven months to be exact, I came into a realization.  Me crying and thinking about what I’ve lost would never change a thing to the current situation that I’m here and my friends were there. At that moment, I decided to start living for myself.</p>

<p>What ended up working for me was that I gave myself time to grieve.  Even though I would cry daily, I would have it for a short amount of time, and still letting my entire day to continue. I would cry in the bathroom or before going to sleep, but I would still eat on time be excited about my new surroundings and try to learn new things.</p>

<h1 id="a-time-when-i-had-fun">A time when I had fun</h1>

<p>There are many kinds of fun: drunk, being belligerent, competing, winning, attaining a goal.  One of the most fun I had was achieving a new personal record on squatting 225 lbs.  The hurdle has always been not being able to progress to it enough.</p>

<p>I remember going to the gym regularly &amp; logging my lifts, watching that I would eat enough, and sleeping on a daily schedule.  I continued doing that for months and until one day, I was able to lift 225 lbs for 5 reps. I was ecstatic and even did a fist-pump and cracked a huge smile right after.</p>

<p>It was fun for me because I achieved something that I’ve been working on for months. It also helped that I was logging my progress which includes the weight lifted, food ate, and hours of sleep.</p>

<h1 id="how-you-chose-to-be-in-product-management">How you chose to be in Product Management</h1>

<p>My goal is to find a career that suits my personal needs – my need for growth.  One of the obstacles is to be able to use the 8 hours of my working day to accompany this growth.</p>

<p>I got laid off recently for the second time. It was an interruption that was timely for now I am able to think about how I want to grow.  One aspect of my life that I feel I would want to grow in is the social/emotional aspect. Being able to connect with people.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading on &amp; off for the past 2 years on what it takes to be a Product Manager and what Product Management is all about. Well, I can tell you that it is still a position that utilizes technical skills and knowledge and, at the same time, utilizes business skills. The business skills part contain the social/emotional aspect of dealing with people.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I’ve attended a number of seminars and talks where panels discussed their Product Management experiences. Though it’s embellished a little bit, their talks definitely made me more curious about the profession.</p>

<p>Overall, based on what I’m capable of – me being technical – coupled with the way I’ve been wanting to grow – social/emotional aspect – I am certain that Product Management will be an exciting career choice for me.  In addition, the research I’ve been doing for the past 2 years and presentations I’ve attended definitely made me more curious about the position.</p>

<p>There will definitely be some challenges with the position, but it’s these new challenges I want to be able to master for sure.</p>

<p>I do know that I want to be a product manager. I have always been technical: math, science, engineering, programming, and other similar activities.</p>

<h1 id="that-time-when-you-showed-an-alternative">That time when you showed an alternative:</h1>

<p>My team and I were assigned the task to create an advertisement banner that would allow clients to showcase their Facebook Timeline.  My manager and team leader was certain that we would have to use a Proxy Server because of two things: 1) Facebook is very strict about what info gets shared, and 2) One of our competitors that has a similar product feature was using a proxy server. Having a proxy server seemed like a reasonable course; after all, our competitor was already using the approach. However, it would pose some red-tape barrier on approval and maintenance that my team foresaw.</p>

<p>Being the front-developer on our team, I had to create a prototype of the product. On creating the product, I researched online resources, which included forums, stackoverflow, and facebook documentation.  I slowly found out that it was possible to get a FaceBook JSON file from the via Facebook Graph API and display this information directly on a website without the need of a proxy server.</p>

<p>I further enhanced the prototype by adding some design to it. I presented the prototype to my team at one of our scrums, and my boss was really happy about what I’ve found out and made. We no longer have to rely on using a proxy server which would expedite the product delivery and would no longer have to rely on further approvals from within the company. My manager was really happy about it that he relayed the good news to the upper management.</p>

<h1 id="that-time-when-you-improved-a-processworkflow">That time when you improved a process/workflow:</h1>

<p>When I was at Lucasfilm I noticed that there were a lot of similar processes that my team would do whenever we would finalize an edit on an still image before it gets sent to production. For example, There would be 6 types of image files (like shadow, occlusion, and color passes) that would have to be imported as layers in Photoshop and arranged in proper order. The artists in my team would manually import these into Photoshop and arrange them accordingly – which costs some time because we are dealing with really large, high density images.  This of course would add up if you have several artists working on various images and the wait time was definitely cumbersome.</p>

<p>After researching on the possible ways, I wrote some JavaScript code and made a Photoshop plug-in that would automate the tasks of importing several image files and arranging them in proper order.</p>

<p>My teammates was definitely happy with what I’ve created as it sped up their production and the tasks has been simplified for them. They’re definitely have been motivated on speeding up the workflow.</p>
