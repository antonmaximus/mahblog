## Assessing Data Objectively

Last year September, my squats was 205x4.  This September of this year it's 245x3.  It may appear like a 40 pound increase over the 12 months.  However, there are a few important distinctions:

* In the 2013 video, I was doing a high-bar squat.  In the data below, I switched from low-bar squat to ATG squat.
* In 2013, my 1repmax was 235 lbs.  In the past 12 months, the highest I had was 273 lbs. (1repmax provides a more accurate comparison between lifts)



Conclusion, looking at the data, there was about a 40-pound increase in my squats.  I'm not sure if this is an average increase (I'm gonna ask the interwebz), but definitely it's progress!  My goal for the next 12 months is to keep the increase around 40 lbs if possible.  (Unfortunately, I'm currently nursing a hip flexor injury which already has me on a slow start.)
