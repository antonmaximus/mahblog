The rule of thumb is  to always warm-up before lifting any weights in order to minimize injuries.  I've sustained a few injuries in the past (mostly due to improper form) and it's no fun being unable to do any intense physical activity for several months.  Even if the injury is specific to one muscle (e.g., right shoulder), chances are you won't be able to function fully for any physical activity.


My current warm-up routine is as follows:

* Three to four minutes of jog on the treadmill to increase body temperature, blood flow, and loosen the lower body.
* One to two minutes of simple calisthenics for the upper body (e.g., arm rotation, push-ups, etc.).
* Then warm-up sets similar to Berkhans's :

      "...personally, I only warm up on compound movements and I do something
      along these lines - sets of 4-6 reps of 40%, 60% and 80% of the
      target weight for the work set. Example: target weight being 200 lbs in 
      the first work set, warm up with 6 x 80 lbs, 5 x 120 lbs and 4 x 160 lbs."

Of course, you want to warm-up to the point where it doesn't negatively effect your working sets.  Like Berkhan says, "the warm up sets aint rocket science. If you think your warm ups may be affecting your top sets negatively, just go easier on them."
