The big three are as follows:

* Deadlift
* Bench Press
* Squats

These three are compound movements and they're all that your body needs.  
A close fourth would be chin-ups, but that's for another post.  
I repeat, you do not have to do anything else if you do these three.

There are also cases when you can substitute some exercises because of injuries.  However, it should be noted that if you're a regular-functioning individual, you should never avoid these exercises.  If you find them difficult, it's because you haven't done them with the correct form.  So lighten up the weight load and perform them again and again until you have the proper technique... after all, you only learn through repetition.  There are no shortcuts.  These three are essential to achieve the remaining 30% of your body recomposition.

In the case you really want to do some calf raises or dumbbell curls, just make sure you add that exercise to the big 3.
