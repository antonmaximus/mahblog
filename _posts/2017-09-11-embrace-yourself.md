The 3rd tenet of my philosophy. At a very young age, we've always been bombarded
with what society deems as beautiful, ideal, lovable. We can see them in movies,
televisions, and print. However, we're not photoshopped individuals or CGI-enhanced
people. I've never been more prouder to embrace myself. Though late to the game,
I feel there's a lot of things I need to learn more about myself.
