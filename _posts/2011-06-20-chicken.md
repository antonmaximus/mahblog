With my recent use of a broiler for fish, I tried to incorporate it to chicken breasts (since the grocery store had a sale on chicken breasts recently)...

Cooking chicken breasts is very basic [as seen in the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMaplo1J6w).  There are a few things to keep in mind: 

* Never under cook chicken meat, as you can get sick.
* Boneless chicken breasts dry out easily, so avoid overcooking.
* Cook time: For boneless/skinless chicken breast, about 20 minutes. (Temperature: about 350 Fahrenheit)
* Drizzle with oil or melted butter especially if it becomes too dry. 
* Vary the seasoning and experiment for your tasting pleasure.  Like, [topping it with cheese](http://www.chickenrecipesweb.com/baked-chicken-breasts-swiss-cheese/).

Best of all, chicken breasts have great nutritional reputation (boneless, skinless chicken breast):
