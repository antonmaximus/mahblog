For the past decade, I've been avoiding fish for two reasons: mercury content and  too much cooking effort.  I've been a fool for believing believing all that mercury stuff without questioning.  I should've investigated better... and sooner.  

I did my investigation recently and found out that I've been missing out on these facts:


* Selenium protects against mercury toxicity, and 16 of the 25 highest dietary sources of selenium are ocean fish
* If a fish contains higher levels of selenium than mercury, it is safe to eat
* Most species of commonly eaten fish in the U.S. have more selenium than mercury
* Fish are not significant sources of PCBs and dioxins when compared to meat, dairy or vegetables
* The benefits of eating fish regularly far outweigh the potential risks, which are neglible
* Pregnant mothers and young children should eat 2-3 servings of oily ocean fish each week

So Fish is very safe to eat -- first problem solved.  The remaining problem is cooking.  I don't want to spend one hour in the kitchen to prepare a meal.  After doing some online research and talking to my network, I concluded that these are the 2 easiest ways:

1. **Steaming.**  It takes about 15 minutes to cook 4 fillets of fish.  The best part is I get to cook rice with it as well because of this [wonderful device from the 90's](http://www.amazon.com/Aroma-Arc-743-1Ngr-Uncooked-Cooked-Steamer/dp/B0057XGM5W/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1392019065&sr=8-4&keywords=rice+cooker)!

2. **Broiling.** It takes about 15 minutes to broil fillets.  For [fish with bone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0xIoM85E0), it takes about 25 minutes.  



Best of all, this is the reason why I eat fish often:
