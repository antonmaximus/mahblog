If you asked me back then when I was starting to understand the interwebz that if I'll ever make a blog, I would say "NO." I'm not a big fan of facebook, myspace, or twitter. To me, blogging was in the same realm.

I'm blogging now because I want to keep a record of the trivial things in life -- like food. Yeah, it's that simple stuff that keeps me alive for each of my waking mornings. I want to get my food stuff right. After all, I deal with it everyday, so I might as well deal with it properly.

Yeah, food may sound too trivial to have a blog for. After all, it's "Conventional Wisdom" (CW), right? However, if one looks at CW closely, CW has gotten it wrong on a lot of occasions throughout history. For example, just look at what CW's stance on [smoking 50 years ago vs. now](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-definitive-guide-to-conventional-wisdom/), and I won't even get started on the recommended/approved Food Pyramid (which I'll discuss in the future).

I'm hoping that I get to update this blog regularly throughout my lifetime or until I got my food stuff "perfect." I'll try to keep all entries short and to the point.

And as for my audience and who they might be...? I'm expecting my audience to be only those people who know me personally -- especially those who may want to learn from what has worked for me as far as food is concerned.

And as a fair warning... read at your own risk. Before you practice any of what I practice, give it a good thought (use your coconut!). Peace out.
