There comes a time when a guy has to graduate from sneakers. After doing research on what shoes I'd like to partake in for the next years of my life, I've discovered bucks, bluchers, and loafers. 


## Choices, choices, choices...

I'm a shorts man. It's the most comfortable attire for me because I have thick legs (thanks for squatting). For this reason, I've decided to incorporate shoes that can work with shorts. After going thorough Reddit's MaleFashionAdvice sub, I've discovered loafers, bluchers, and bucks. Am now learning how to incorporate them in my wardrobe. 

**1. Loafers.** There are [various kinds of loafers](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ansx6/penny_loafers_3_in_a_series_of_springsummer_boat/).  However, beefroll penny loafers appeal to me the most. The contrast between the stitches and the material give a more casual vibe for me.

**2. Bluchers.**  Bluchers are lace-up shoes and they are the casual versions of oxford shoes -- really formal dress shoes.  A thorough [definition between bluchers and oxfords can be seen on this link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/shoe_jargon.jpg).  

Furthermore, Brogues shoes are shoes with perforation. I've discovered that blucher brogues can go well with shorts.  I am set to own a pair of blucher brogues with wingtip perforation.  Wingtip is one of [several brogue perforation styles](http://perfectgentlemansa.blogspot.com/2010/10/brogues-vs-wingtips.html).


**3. Bucks.** Bucks are shoes made of suede or nubuck and has a blucher-type of lacing. They're pretty versatile as long as it's not raining or wet -- especially since suede/nubuck don't go well with wet weather.  Most common colors are tan and white.
