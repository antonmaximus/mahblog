Track Yourself.  See the forest for the trees

Sometimes we get caught up with the details that 
we fail to see the forest for the trees. The best way to combat this is to track
one's self. Am I overly disheartened that I haven't hit 3 plates of squats yet?
Hey guess, what? Why don't you look back 6 months ago, and see where you are at 
now. Maybe that'll help you figure out the accomplishments and setbacks you've had. 

There's nothing else really much to say other than say good luck. 

How much do I enjoy this? Do I like what I do? Do more of what you like and do it 
a lot. We're in this world for a limited time. It would suck to not do what you 
like while you're here. I'm rambling.
