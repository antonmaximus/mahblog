TCU Interview was 10/21/2019, Monday.

The TCU interview was awesome! Okay, it was not that awesome "awesome," but I felt very thankful for being invited to be interviewed. It made me feel that my qualifications were good, especially being part of their 3rd (out of 11) interview days. 

What went right: 

* I was able to connect all of my answers to my experiences. 
* Had plenty of practice leading to the interview!
* Dressed right. 
* Consistent with my meal pattern night prior and during (eg., kinds of food and timing)



What could have been better: 

* The way I spoke could have used more paralanguage and gestures.
* "mistake" == "learning opportunity" (Oprah: there are no mistakes, there are only learning opportunities.)
* Role-play on how you would say your "approach" in front of interviewer.• Take more time to give context. For example, your entire tech career gave you the understanding and not just Lucasfilm.
* My necktie. 
* Role-play:  
 * Thank them for sharing (highlight bravery!) 
 * Check safety (breathing exercises too!) 
 * Ask "Emotions Experienced" (Validate!) 
  * Whole message: (Observe/Validate/Sense what they objectively seem like as they're through these emotions. My thinking that the problem won't be solved overnight and can recur again. My feeling that we need to be strong through this moment and recurring times. My need for them to continue to be brave and reach out to me and more or safety plan!).
